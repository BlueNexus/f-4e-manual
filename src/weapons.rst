M61A1 Vulcan Cannon - Internal and External
*******************************************

Internal M61A1 Vulcan 20mm Cannon
=================================

The General Electric M61 Vulcan cannon finally went to war as an integral part of the Phantom with the advent of the F-4E, with the nose profile and APQ-120 modified to fit the weapon.  Carrying 639 rounds in the internal drum, the six-barreled Gatling style rotary cannon provides a user-selectable rate of fire from 4000 to 6000 rounds per minute, delivering a muzzle velocity in excess of 3,450 ft/s, with armor piercing incindeary and high explosive incindeary round options available.  Useful in both air to air and air to ground roles, the Vulcan was used for four confirmed kills by the USAF over Vietnam with the F-4E. 

To utilize the M61, the GUN station select switch must be selected, the Master Arm must be ON, and the Gun selection on the Pinky Switch (Aft) must be actuated.  This will illuminate the GUN lamp on the Head Up Display.  

For air to air usage, the optical sight should be selected to A/A mode.  In air to air mode, the optical sight functions as a lead computing optical sighting (LCOS), thus maneuvering in both elevation and azimuth relative to a radar locked target, or a default 1000' range setting in the event of no lock.  With a lock, the range bar presentation is relative to 6700' just to the left of the tick at the 1 o-clock position, down to 1000' at the 6 o-clock position.

For air to ground use, the optical sight should be selected to A/G mode, the Delivery Mode knob should be set in the OFF or Direct mode, and the desired sight depression mil setting be entered for the intended attack profile.  Depression is set relative from the Fuselage Reference Line (FRL).  While Depression will lower the reticle in elevation, there is no azimuth drift due to relative aircraft motion.

Gun rate is controlled with the Rate switch on the Pedestal panel, and is selctable as High (6000 rounds per minute) or Low (4000 rounds per minute).  Also on the Pedestal panel is the gun rounds remaining indicator.

Of note is the Auto Clear function; the cannon will fire approximately between 5 and 11 rounds from the point the pilot has released the trigger to clear all bolt actions in the cannon; this spindown takes approximately one second, and the gun cannot be fired again during this operation.  While the Pedestal panel carries the Auto Clear switch, this switch does not have any control over the internal M61A1 cannon, and can only deactivate round clearance for podded external cannon installations.  


SUU-16/A and SUU-23/A External 20mm Vulcan Cannon Pods
======================================================

Built to both provide gun capability to aircraft that did not mount them internally, and to increase available direct fire in the close air support mission, the SUU-16/A and SUU-23/A gun pods were both built around the M61A1 and a 1200 round ammunition load.  Both pods are fixed-rate at 6000 rounds per minute, and up to three can be concurrently installed and driven by the fire control system; while up to five can be loaded for ferry purposes, and promotional images have shown such a configuration, only three can be activated.

The primary difference between the -16/A and -23/A pods are their method of power; the former using a ram air turbine arrangement to drive its motor, while the latter is internally powered.  This difference had an effect on relative utility- while the -23/A could be fired at any airspeed, thus allowing it to be loaded onto slower aircraft, the -16/A's ram air turbine required a minimum speed of 300 knots to fire, and only reached its optimum performance above 400 knots. Both pods have an auto-clear function for safety, which cause rounds loaded in the breeches to be released back into the ammo bin, which does entail a momentary delay of one to two seconds prior to being able to fire the pod again.   

Activation of the SUU pods are performed by selecting their respective Station Select switches, and placing the Delivery Mode knob in OFF or Direct.  The Weapon Selector knob can be in any position other than TV or ARM, unless CAGE mode is activated.  The desired Auto-Clear setting should be selected, and Master Arm set to ON to activate the pod.  On the SUU-16, the Master Arm activation deploys the ram air turbine.

Installed, the guns are boresighted along the Fuselage Reference Line.  Thus, with the optical sight in air to air mode, the rounds will fall in accordance with reticle center, just as the main cannon- only with the natural offset of their respective pylon position, thus allowing for effective natural gunnery, if only affected by a moderate increase in resulting CEP.  In the same fashion, in air to ground mode, the SUU pods observe the same performance relative to the reticle depression schedule as the internal cannon, again, with their respective offsets from centerline and CEP increase.

To safe the gun pods after combat, prior to deactivating Master Arm, the Auto Clear switch should be placed into the Auto Clear position, the trigger sqeezed momentarily, and the respective Station Select buttons pushed to off.  On the SUU-16, this will close the ram air turbine.

Air to Air Weapons
******************

AIM-7 Sparrow
=============

Originally designated the AAM-N-6 Sparrow III, the AIM-7 Sparrow saw initial service entry with the United States Navy in 1958.  Unlike the beam-riding AIM-7A (AAM-N-2 Sparrow I), which required the launching aircraft to maintain boresight on the target for the flyout of the weapon, the semi-active radar homing AIM-7C could effectively engage a maneuvering target well off boresight, so long as the designating aircraft's radar could maintain a lock during the missile's intercept.  The AIM-7C quickly gave way to the 7D, which saw a number of kills over Vietnam, and the 7E, which scored the majority of the type's kills in Southeast Asia. Additionally, the F-4E saw compatility with the AIM-7F and AIM-7M.  

Utilization of the AIM-7 begins with tuning the onboard rounds, performed with the RDR MSL switch, selecting it into the CW ON position.  This tuning process takes approximately one minute, and can be initiated once power has been applied for at least one minute to the radar (any position out of OFF) in most operating environments (ambient temperature below 90 degrees F).  The missiles are properly tuned when the missile status light (RDR) is illuminate in each station carrying a Sparrow missile for at least one minute.  After successful tuning, the RDR MSL switch can be returned to the STBY (Standby) position.  The status lamps will turn off once returned to STBY.  Once in the combat area, the RDR MSL switch should be returned to the CW ON position, to maintain proper missile kystron tuning state during the engagement. 

To employ an AIM-7, the Optical Sight should be placed into the A/A position, which stabilizes the Reticle at the Radar Boresight Line in the window.  The roll tabs function to provide the pilot with relative roll attitude guidance in instrument conditions (weather or nighttime), and the right side of the 50 mil diameter circle (outer) functions as a range bar when a radar lock is achieved against a target, displaying ranges up to 20,000' (top) to 3000' (bottom), with 12,000' signified at the 3 o-clock position.  

When radar lock on against a target is achieved with AIM-7 selected, a pair of strobes surround the locked target in azimuth.  Identified as Rmax and Rmax 2, they represent effective ranges against a 1 G target (Rmax), and a high rate maneuvering target based on altitude (Rmax 2, representing 8G up to 20k, 6G to 35k, and 4G above 35,000'). When a missile is launched, the Rmax 2 strobe falls to the bottom of the display, and begins driving upwards towards the target lock; this functions as a missile flyout timer.  When the timer reaches the locked target, it can be assumed the missile has arrived.  The display does not provide Rmin, but instead reverts to a break X warning superimposed over the radar image should Rmin be attained for a Sparrow launch.

Prior to engagement, a determination must be made as to whether or not the missile interlocks will be kept in, or positioned out.  The interlocks preclude an AIM-7 shot when outside of effective firing parameters, those being the missile in range (illuminating the IN RANGE light), the target aim dot within the ASE (Allowable Steering Error) circle on the radar display, and the radar display mode out of VI (Vis-Ident mode).   

With the interlocks in, should any of the three aforementioned restrictions be met- target out of range, aim dot outside the ASE, or the radar left in VI, a trigger actuation will not cause the release of a missile.  With interlocks out, an AIM-7 will be released no matter the condition of the three interlocks.

When parameters are met, the the SHOOT lamps will illuminate. Found in both cockpits, these lights reinforce the condition of good launch conditions for the AIM-7.  In the event a target enters a main beam clutter situation (aspect angle between 81 and 99 degrees and lower than 5 degrees above the horizon), the lights will turn off, even though the interlock requirements are met.  Maneuver should be utilized to bring the target outside this region prior to launch.

At the point of engagement, AIM-7 missiles are selected using the Pinky Switch on the outboard (left) throttle arm, selecting the forward position.  This illuminates the RADAR lamp on the Head Up Display panel. 

Before employing the AIM-7E Sparrow, a delay of four seconds should be given if the Master Arm switch is set in the ON position prior to radar lock on, or a delay of two seconds if the Master Arm switch is set to ON after radar lock on.  This is due to the set-in period of the missile speedgate.  With the AIM-7F, this delay is reduced to two seconds with Master Arm On prior to lock, or immediately after selecting Master Arm to On if lock on was achieved first.  Should these delays not be adhered to, the missile may fail to track because of improper target doppler injection.

With the target in parameters or interlocks out, pressing the trigger fires off an AIM-7.  A second AIM-7 can be fired immediately at the same target, if desired, by releasing, then squeezing the trigger a second time- holding it on the second actuation.  

The launch sequence for the AIM-7 missile is 

Left Forward
Right Forward
Left Rear
Right Rear

In the event of a centerline store or tank precluding forward missile release, the CL TK lamp will illuminate.  Rear missiles may still be fired, and the forward missiles may be fired if the a centerline tank is dropped or MER is jettisoned.  The lamp also illuminates in the event of a BRU-5/A in the centerline position, however, a missile can be launched in that condition.  The Aero-27 precludes any release, even if the round has been dropped.


AIM-9 Sidewinder
================

Entering service with the United States Navy in 1956, and finally accepted by the United States Air Force in 1964, the short range, infrared seeking AIM-9 Sidewinder is considered by most to be the world's first truly effective air to air guided missile. Beginning with the AIM-9B and maintaining compatibility to the AIM-9M in US service, the Sidewinder provided the Phantom II with a capable close-in weapon system against rapidly maneuvering opponents.

Employment of the AIM-9 can be performed with or without a radar lock, and is initiated by selecting Master Arm to ON and selecting the Throttle Pinky Switch to the center postion for Heat.  The HEAT lamp on the Head Up Display will illuminate, and available AIM-9 missiles will illuminate on the Missile Status Panel.  The Optical Sight should be selected to A/A, and the reticle will stabilize at the Radar Boresight Line, which is the boresight location for the Sidewinders on the rails.  

Should a radar lock be achieved, the sight will display the range bar on the right side as previously described, with 20,000' indicated at the top, and 3,000' range indicated at the bottom. With a radar lock on, the radar will display a pair of strobes signifying Rmax and Rmin for the Sidewinder against the target under current launch conditions. 

It is important to note that the AIM-9 does not receive a guidance handoff from the APQ-120 like on later aircraft to direct the seeker's look angle.  Instead, the ASE circle presents the aim dot against the target to bring it to the RBL.  Centering the aim dot in the ASE aligns the target to the RBL, thus allowing for rapid acquisition by the seeker of the selected AIM-9.  Once the missile's tone changes to signify lock, the pilot can then select the AAR button on the grip to allow for Sidewinder self-track (seeker uncage); this function allows the seeker to maintain acquisition of the target (noted by the shifted audio tone), while permitting maneuver of the aircraft to a better aspect angle or range solution prior to launch if the situation allows.  The amount of maneuver available to a given Sidewinder type is based on the variant, and should be considered before making the selection.

Once the desired firing solution is attained, the AIM-9 is launched using the trigger.

Specialized ACM Functions: CAGE and CAA
=======================================

CAGE Mode
---------

In the event that an AIM-7, AIM-9, or M61A1 must be employed against an airborne target with the sight in A/G mode (for example, the flight is bounced by opposing aircraft), the optical sight reticle can immediately be slewed to the Radar Boresight Line using the Cage Button, found on the inboard (right) throttle handle.  Cage mode commands the radar into BST mode with a five mile range, and short pulse, and sets the firing circut for the currently selected air to air weapon relative to the Pinky Switch.  For the optical sight, the command activates the respective elevation and azimuth tracking, roll mark, and range functions of the reticle for the chosen weapon, without the pilot having to remove a hand from throttle or stick to swap the sight mode or weapon control panel functions.  

Should a track condition exist prior to pressing Cage and the Pinky switch is in Radar or Heat position, the lock is broken when the button is pressed, and the antenna slaves to boresight when released.  If the Pinky Switch is in the Gun position, the lock is not broken.

Cage mode can be exited from either cockpit, by placing Weapon Select knob in the pilot cockpit to the B position momentarially, or by the WSO pressing the Air to Air button on the rear cockpit panel.  If the pilot leaves the Weapon Select knob in B, it does not preclude a later entry into Cage mode.


Computer Automatic Acquisition Mode (CAA)
-----------------------------------------

Once in Cage mode, the radar can be selected in to Computer Automatic Acquistion using the Nose Gear Steering button.  In CAA, the radar enters a vertical-oriented scan pattern 78 degrees in height by 15 degrees high.  Actual radar lock capability within this scan pattern is from +45 degrees above the horizon line to -9 degrees below the horizon line due to APQ software limitation.  In the event that the radar finds a suitable target within the scan volume, the target will be locked.  Should the flight crew find the locked target not be the one intended, the Nose Gear Steering button can be pressed on either stick grip to return the radar back to the search pattern.

In CAA mode, the radar's search pattern can be shifted left or right utilizing the Pinky Switch.  While this actuation will change the illuminated weapon indicated on the Head Up Display, the actual selected weapon from the point of Cage mode entry does not change.

To exit CAA, the pilot can select position B on the Weapon Select Knob, or the WSO can push the Air to Air button.  Should a radar lock be in place at the time of mode exit, it will be retained.

Air-to-Ground Weapons
*********************

AGM-65 Maverick
===============

Entering service in 1972, the AGM-65 air to surface missile provided the Phantom II with a direct-fire long range weapon, capable of destroying armor, mechanized infantry, and other targets with electro-optical, and later- infrared imaged, accuracy.  The F-4E was capable of carrying up to six between the two inboard wing pylons.

Employment of the Maverick is shared between both cockpits, with the pilot responsible for stores and mode selection, and initial seeker placement.  From the point the seeker head is stabilized on the intended target area, either crew member can direct the final intended contrast target. 

To utilize a Maverick of any variant, the pilot begins by pressing the applicable Station Select buttons, and setting Master Arm to On. The pilot then must select Direct on the Delivery Mode Knob, and the TV position on the Weapon Select Knob.  

When selected to TV, the 3 minute missile gyro warmup sequence initiates; it is suggested to start the stopwatch to the left of the Multiple Weapon Panel as a means to avoid disturbing this sequence.  Once the warmup has completed, the lower amber ARM indicators on the Station Select buttons will illuminate.  Failure to permit this gyro cycle can potentially damage the guidance unit of the missiles aboard.  During this warmup period, it is necessary to set the optical sight to A/G mode, and enter a depression of 45 mils, so that the sight alignment be that of the missile seeker.

Once the warmup has completed, the crew may activate their displays for viewing seeker video; the pilot selects the TV position on the Scope Display Select switch on the Pedestal panel, and the WSO places the radar display mode knob to TV.

With the displays activated, the pilot maneuvers the aircraft to position the sight reticle over the target area, and either crew member can then press their respective flight stick trigger to initiate video.  With video active, command of the missile seeker is controlled by the crew member who activated the video signal, as follows:

Pilot:

With the pipper over the target area, pressing and holding the AAR button enables track slewing with the Forward Hand Control stick inboard from the throttle.  Once the seeker crosshair is over the intended target, releasing the AAR button performs a lock-on of the missile to the contrast area under the crosshair.  If the missile seeker fails to achieve lock on the correct target, the lock can be broken by squeezing the trigger again, bringing the missile seeker back to its boresight position, and then reattempting the lock with the AAR button. Should the target not appear to have enough contrast versus the background around it, the contrast can be swapped from black hot to white hot, or vice versa, using the Target Contrast Switch on the Pedestal panel.  Leaving the switch in the Auto position allows the seeker to attempt to determine the best option for contrast. 

Should a missile appear to not be functioning correctly, it can be rejected to the next round in the release sequence using the TGT/MSL REJ switch. 

Once lock on the correct target is attained, the missile is launched using the bomb button. To initiate lock on of the next target, the process is started over with the squeezing of the trigger.

With the above in mind for the electro-optical AGM-65A and B, the AGM-65D has a few minor alterations to the proecdure.  The seeker of the 65D has two FOV settings, wide and narrow, and initial video signal is provided in the wide setting. In this setting, a quartet of L shaped brackets define the region of the display that will be zoomed in upon selecting the narrow field of view. Pressing the trigger a second time changes the video to the narrow setting, allowing for a more precise selection of the target.  


WSO: 

The WSO performs the same sequence of actions for the seeker guidance, and can initiate video upon pilot confirmation of pipper location using the trigger of his own flight stick in the rear cockpit.  From this point, the WSO uses the the radar's cursor control stick to manage the seeker head placement, lock, and in the case of AGM-65D employment FoV controls.  Rather than pressing and holding the AAR button to activate slew, the WSO selects the half-action trigger position, and then slews the seeker using the cursor control.  

Once the appliable target is under the crosshair, lock is achieved using the full action command. Should the WSO need to change 65D FoV to narrow, a subsequent press of half action will do so.  The WSO can change the contrast mode with the Contrast Switch on the left side console next to the radar display panel.  And, once lock is achieved, the WSO can fire the missile using the Missile Launch button found on his flight stick- in the same position as the Bomb Release button on the front stick. 


Conventional Bombs - Mk 80 Series
=================================

The Phantom II's bread and butter in the air to ground role, the Mk 80 series conventional bombs were first dropped in combat over North Vietnam.  The F-4E is able to deliver the 500 lb Mk 82, the 1000 lb Mk 83, and 2000 lb Mk 84.  Of note is the selectable drag option Mk 82 variant known as Snakeye.  With the selectable fin arrangement on the round, the deployable fins remain in position in the low drag profile, and deploy as a cruciform aerobraking device in the high drag setting.  This change in setting is managed with the Nose/Tail Arming switch.


Laser Guided Bombs - GBU-10, 12, and 24
=======================================

Built around the Mk 80 series of conventional bombs, the Paveway series precision bomb kits install a guidance section and directional maneuvering fin section to the Mk 82 (GBU-12) and Mk 84 (GBU-10 and 24) general purpose rounds, respectively.  Utilizing the Pave Spike laser targeting pod or buddy lasing, the Paveway's resulting performance delivered a substantial increase to the Phantom's bombing accuracy, with the later GBU-24's larger fin arrangement providing greater glide range for the 2000 lb round over the original GBU-10. 


Anti-Tank Cluster Bombs - Mk 20 Rockeye
=======================================

Carrying 247 Mk 118 anti-tank bomblets, the Mk 20 Rockeye is used to deliver said potency across a wide dispersal area.  The Mk 20 has a base schedule dispersal time depending on variant (4 seconds in the Mod 2 variant, and 1.2 seconds in the Mod 3), along with a ground crew selectable option time that is programmed prior to takeoff.  In concert, once over the target area the pilot can select the necessary option through the Nose/Tail Arming switch, and deliver the weapon with the profile most suited to the target. 


Mk 4 Series 2.75 Folding Fin Aerial Rockets - FFAR
==================================================

Also known as the Mighty Mouse, the Mk 4 series of unguided aerial rockets originated as an air to air weapon.  Given the rocket's undirected nature, tendency for wide dispersion in salvo usage, and overall poor performance in its intended role- most notably an incident in which over 200 rounds were fired by a pair of F-89 Scorpions in a failed attempt to down an uncommanded target drone, the Mighty Mouse was wholly unfit for purpose.  However, the rocket's peculiar traits were ingeniously capitalized upon by transitioning it to the role of an air to ground area effect weapon. 

Having become a useful tool, the original Mk 4's capability was expanded upon with a wide array of warheads, including smoke, anti-personnel flechette, and those used by the USAF on the Phantom- the m156 White Phosphorous, Mk 1 High Explosive, and the Mk 5 High Exposive Anti Tank.  Depending on the hardpoint location and configuration, up to 3 LAU-3 pod launchers can be installed per hardpoint, each carrying 19 FFARs per.  



BDU Series Training Bombs
=========================

Depending on the training requirements and range needs, the Phantom II can carry the BDU-33 25 lb training bomb, the BDU-45 500 lb trainin bomb, or the BDU-50 500 lb training bomb, in either low or high drag configuration, to simulate the carriage and release profile of standard Mk 82 and Snakeye rounds.

Air-to-Ground Weapons Modes
===========================

LOFT
----

Loft bombing is utilized to deliver multiple bombs with minimum exposure to ground fire and no target flyover.  As the name entails, the aircraft transitions from a low altitude to a higher one in a pullup, thus lofting the released munitions at a pre-calculated point that reaches the target.  

Planning for a loft attack requires a known target location, so that distances for the IP and respective bomb ranges can be calculated.  The ballistics tables are references to determine delivery pattern and pullup-to-target range.  With this information, the number of bombs can be decided, which determines the spread, and knowing the pullup to target range- the pullup point distance to the IP can be chosen.  As the path from IP to pullup is flown at a constant speed, this can then be used to determined time from said distance for Pullup Timer entry.  And with the ballstic table reference for the LOW angle, the profile is set. 

Upon entry to the target area, the pilot flies the intended course to the IP, and once over, presses and holds the bomb release button to initiate the run.  Flying direct or crabbed to the pullup point, the pilot maintains the bomb release button in the down position, and holds it until the desired munitions have released.

In LOFT mode, the ARBCS programs for a 4.0 G pullup schedule, and will automatically release the selected munitions once the bombing run is initiated, timer runout has occurred, and pre-set LOW pitch (gyro) angle is achieved. At the initiation of the bomb run, upon pressing the bomb button, the ARBCS overrides any other navigational guidance provided on the ADI and assumes command of the pointers to show deviation relative to the programmed attack profile.  The vertical pointer offsets in the direction requiring yaw input to maintain target alignment.  On approach to the loft point, the horizontal needle shows deviation from a 1.0 G flight path.  When the pullup timer completes signaling the 4.0 G pullup, deviation of the horizontal needle is relative to the desired constant 4.0 G pull, with the initial drift representing achieving 4.0 G of load in two seconds.  Maintaining the horizontal needle centered means the pilot has increased and held G at the proper rate for maximum accuracy.  Control of the ADI by the AN/AJB-7 is maintained until the pilot releases the bomb button after the last desired munition is released.


Dive Toss - DT
--------------

Dive Toss uses WRCS radar tracking, in conjunction with other aircraft sensors, to calculate the release solution in real time.  The target can be approached from any direction, airspeed, and dive angle, and the WRCS computes the proper release point relative to the the acquired track, munition drag coeffcient setting, and any release advance control input (in conjunction with AWRU settings).  

To perform a Dive Toss attack, the radar must be set in AIR-GRD mode, with a 5 or 10 mile range setting.  Once set, the pilot initiates the attack with the Optical Sight in Air-to-Ground mode, and the reticle automatically cages in elevation along the RBL.  The pilot then selects DT on the Delivery Mode Knob, places Weapon Selector Knob in BOMBS, and selects the desired Interval and Quantity on the respective AWRU knobs.  At this point, the pilot can initiate the attack.

The attack is initiated in a dive.  The required dive is roughly 20% higher than that required for a Direct mode attack, as to achieve effective radar ground lock; that is, the radar must get a solid ground return, rather than see the actual target being bombed.  Once lockon is achieved, the pilot then maneuvers to place the pipper over the intended target, wings level, then presses and holds the bomb button to insert radar range to the WRCS, and then begins the desired pullout maneuver, maintaining wings level.  After the pilot pushes the bomb release button, radar ground lock is no longer required.  The pullout maneuver must maintain as constant a rate of turn as possible for maximum precion.  

At the point where the bomb computed trajectory will intersect the target, the WRCS provides the release signal, dropping rounds based on the settings chosen for number and interval.


Dive Laydown - DL
-----------------

Similar to Dive Toss, Dive Laydown is available for saturation delivery of high drag weapons where range has little effect on the intended release parameters.  Rather than a computed release range, the bombing table release range is set directly in the WRCS panel, and the pilot flies the ballistic schedule speed (true airspeed or ground speed) at the given altitude above the target to produce the given release range.  

Dive Laydown is selected by placing the Delivery Mode Knob in DL, and choosing either RKTS & DISP (for dispensers/CBU only) or BOMBS.  Desired release range is entered on the WRCS panel, and, if necessary, the release advance control. 

The start of the attack is the same as Dive Toss; a higher than normal dive angle is flown, with the radar in AIR-GRD mode at 5 or 10 mile range, a solid return is generated, and the pilot then positions the pipper on the intended target and holds the bomb release button.  Once this is completed, the pilot pulls out of the dive at the bombing table plan altitude, maintains the target speed and heading with wings level, and the bombs release automatically at the desired range.  The key factors for accuracy in this mode are correct altitude and pitch angle at the point of release. 


Laydown - L
-----------

The Laydown attack mode uses a known optical sight depression value (or IP) to determine range to target, and releases the munitions based on a desired range to target from the bombing tables.  The profile is most useful for lower altitude attacks using high drag munitions.

Setup for the Laydown attack requires the bombing table target range and altitude above target to be entered on the WRCS panel.  The Optical Sight should be set to the depression noted from the tables in Air-to-Ground mode, and the approach to the target should be flown at the true airspeed (or ground speed) listed in the bombing tables for the parameters, wings level.  The AWRU and WRCS Release Advance settings should be entered as desired, and the Weapon Select Knob placed in BOMBS or RKTS & DISP (for dispensers only). 

As the pipper crosses the target, the bomb button should be held until the set spread of munitions has released.
