# AGM-12 Bullpup

![Bullpup](../../../img/bullpup.jpg)

The AGM-12, nicknamed Bullpup, is a guided short-range air-to-ground missile
that can be steered manually by the crew.

Steering commands are send via radio by utilizing the lower UHF antenna of the
Phantom.

It was the first of its kind that reached series production and was used in
service during the early 1960s until it was later supplanted by the
[AGM-62 Walleye](../bombs/tv_guided_bombs.md).
