# Laser Guided Bombs

## GBU-10, 12, and 24

![gbus](../../../img/gbus.jpg)

Built around the Mk 80 series of conventional bombs, the Paveway series
precision bomb kits install a guidance section and directional maneuvering fin
section to the Mk 82 (GBU-12) and Mk 84 (GBU-10 and 24) general purpose rounds,
respectively. Utilizing the Pave Spike laser targeting pod or buddy lasing, the
Paveway's resulting performance delivered a substantial increase to the
Phantom's bombing accuracy, with the later GBU-24's larger fin arrangement
providing greater glide range for the 2000 lb round over the original GBU-10.
