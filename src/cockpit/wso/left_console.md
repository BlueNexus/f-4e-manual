positioned relative to in-range on a closing target, and the WSO selects
full-action. To solidify the track, the WSO uses the Manual Vc knob to place the
range strobe and target return video at the same rate of movement.

#### Automatic

In the AUTO position, the range and closure calculations are performed
automatically. The WSO places the acquisition symbol over the target return and
presses full action. Should the target maneuver in excess of the speed
capability of the radar, the Maneuver switch can be set to HI G and the target
reacquired.

#### AOJ OUT

The AOJ OUT position is used to override the acquisition on jamming function of
the radar. In the event that the radar acquires a HOJ lock, the position can be
selected to place the radar back into a search configuration to initiate a
lockon against the jamming target and initiate a standard angle track lock.

## TACAN Control Panel

![FrontTCN](../../img/FrontTCN.png)

The TACAN Control Panel is used to enter the desired TACAN channel, mode, and
audible volume for the monitoring of said channel by the aircrew. The panel is
duplicated in both cockpits, and the panel in command of the TACAN receiver is
selected with the NAV CMD button the Communication Control Panel.

On the control panel is found two Navigation Channel Control knobs, with the
left controlling the first two digits of the channel value (hundreds and tens),
and the right controls the single unit (ones) values. The right knob also
includes an outer ring which sets the X or Y value for the desired TACAN
channel.

Between these two knobs is the TEST button, which performs the ground testing
cycle after warmup, and can also be used to perform an in-flight confidence test
of the system's performance.

To the upper right, the VOL knob is available to set the desired audio level for
the received TACAN station.

The TACAN Function Selector Knob determines the presentation and type of
information provided on the HSI, ADI, and BDHI, respectively.

| Name    | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OFF     | The TACAN receiver is deenergized and offline.                                                                                                             |
| REC     | The TACAN receiver is active, providing bearing information on the HSI, BDHI, and ADI.                                                                     |
| T/R     | Both the receive and transmit functions of the TACAN are active, which provide bearing and nautical mile range information for the HSI and BDHI.           |
| A/A REC | The TACAN receiver decodes bearing information from compliant aircraft for the HSI, BDHI, and ADI steering display.                                        |
| A/A TR  | The TACAN receiver receives both bearing and slant range information in nautical miles from the transmitting aircraft, providing this on the HSI and BDHI. |

Note: Air to Air TACAN functionality requires the channel to be set 63 channels
above or below the cooperating aircraft, but on the same range- X or Y.

## Communication Control Panel

![CCP](../../img/CCP.png)

The Communication Control Panel provides selection and mode of the UHF radio in
the aircraft. The panel is duplicated in both cockpits, and control over the
radio is determined through pushing the COMM CMD Button in the respective seat;
the button will illuminate green in the seat in priority. In the same fashion,
the NAV CMD button dictates which seat has control of the TACAN settings; its
button will also illuminate in the seat in command of the system.

Beneath the COMM CMD button is the radio volume for the respective seat.
Adjacent to the NAV CMD button is the Squelch switch, which enables or disables
receiver squelch.

The A-3-2-T Selector knob sets HAVE Quick functionality of the UHF radio (A-
auto-jam), the first digit of the manually selected frequency (3 or 2), or
enables Time of Day receipt for one minute after selection in a momentary hold
position (T).

The four Frequency Selection Knobs work in concert with the A-3-2-T knob and
Preset/Manual switch. Frequencies are entered beginning with the 3 or 2
selection on the A-3-2-T Selector, and can be entered from 225.00 to 399.975 MHz
in increments of 0.025. With Preset/Manual in the Manual position, the UHF radio
is directly set to the displayed channel. In the Preset position, the set
channels can entered into the COMM CHAN memory, with the desired position
selected with the Comm Channel Control knob- the smaller knob to the left of the
Preset/Manual switch, and displayed in the COMM CHAN window. Channels are stored
in the displayed channel preset with the SET pushbutton. Once stored, channels
are directly selected using the Comm Channel Control knob with the Preset/Manual
switch in the Preset position.

The Tone Pushbutton is used for transmission of a TOD signal along with a tone
to friendly aircraft requiring a Time of Day update for proper HAVE Quick
functionality. It is also used to activate the emergency TOD clock for the radio
itself, in conjunction with the T position of the A-3-2-T knob. Selecting the T
position and pushing the Tone button will cause the radio to listen for a TOD
signal from another friendly transmitter to synchronize the anti-jam function
with the desired network.

Directly underneath the Comm Channel Control Knob is the Aux Channel Knob and
Indicator. This knob is used to access 20 common preset channels that cannot be
changed from in the cockpit.

The Comm Function Selector Knob determines the current configuration of the
radio system.
