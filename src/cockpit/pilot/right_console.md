![MCRst](../../img/MCRst.png)

Used to extinguish telelight panel warnings and the Master Caution warning lamp
once the necessary action has been taken. In the event a fault has not been
effectively corrected, pressing the Master Caution Reset button will not turn
the respective warning off.

## TACAN Control Panel

![FrontTCN](../../img/FrontTCN.png)

The TACAN Control Panel is used to enter the desired TACAN channel, mode, and
audible volume for the monitoring of said channel by the aircrew. The panel is
duplicated in both cockpits, and the panel in command of the TACAN receiver is
selected with the NAV CMD button of the Communication Control Panel.

On the control panel there are two Navigation Channel Control knobs, with the
left controlling the first two digits of the channel value (hundreds and tens),
and the right controls the single unit (ones) values. The right knob also
includes an outer ring which sets the X or Y value for the desired TACAN
channel.

Between these two knobs is the TEST button, which performs the ground testing
cycle after warmup, and can also be used to perform an in-flight confidence test
of the system's performance.

To the upper right, the VOL knob is available to set the desired audio level for
the received TACAN station.

The TACAN Function Selector Knob determines the presentation and type of
information provided on the HSI, ADI, and BDHI, respectively.

| Name    | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| OFF     | The TACAN receiver is deenergized and offline.                                                                                                             |
| REC     | The TACAN receiver is active, providing bearing information on the HSI, BDHI, and ADI.                                                                     |
| T/R     | Both the receive and transmit functions of the TACAN are active, which provide bearing and nautical mile range information for the HSI and BDHI.           |
| A/A REC | The TACAN reciver decodes bearing information from compliant aircraft for the HSI, BDHI, and ADI steering display.                                         |
| A/A TR  | The TACAN receiver receives both bearing and sland range information in nautical miles from the transmitting aircraft, providing this on the HSI and BDHI. |

Note: Air to Air TACAN functionality requires the channel to be set 63 channels
above or below the cooperating aircraft, but on the same range- X or Y.

## Communication Control Panel

![CCP](../../img/CCP.png)

The Communication Control Panel provides selection and mode of the UHF radio in
the aircraft. The panel is duplicated in both cockpits, and control over the
radio is determined through pushing the COMM CMD Button in the respective seat;
the button will illuminate green in the seat in priority. In the same fashion,
the NAV CMD button dictates which seat has control of the TACAN settings; its
button will also illuminate on the panel of the seat that has command (control)
of the system.

Beneath the COMM CMD button is the radio volume for the respective seat. Close
to the NAV CMD button is the Squelch switch, which enables or disables receiver
squelch.

The A-3-2-T Selector knob sets HAVE Quick functionality of the UHF radio (A-
auto-jam), the first digit of the manually selected frequency (3 or 2), or
enables Time of Day receipt for one minute after selection in a momentary hold
position (T).

The four Frequency Selection Knobs work in concert with the A-3-2-T knob and
Preset/Manual switch. Frequencies are entered beginning with the 3 or 2
selection on the A-3-2-T Selector, and can be entered from 225.00 to 399.975 MHz
in increments of 0.025. With Preset/Manual in the Manual position, the UHF radio
is directly set to the displayed channel. In the Preset position, the set
channels can entered into the COMM CHAN memory, with the desired position
selected with the Comm Channel Control knob- the smaller knob to the left of the
Preset/Manual switch, and displayed in the COMM CHAN window. Channels are stored
in the displayed channel preset with the SET pushbutton. Once stored, channels
are directly selected using the Comm Channel Control knob with the Preset/Manual
switch in the Preset position.

The Tone Pushbutton is used for transmission of a TOD signal along with a tone
to friendly aircraft requiring a Time of Day update for proper HAVE Quick
functionality. It is also used to activate the emergency TOD clock for the radio
itself, in conjunction with the T position of the A-3-2-T knob. Selecting the T
position and pushing the Tone button will cause the radio to listen for a TOD
signal from another friendly transmitter to synchronize the anti-jam function
with the desired network.

Directly underneath the Comm Channel Control Knob is the Aux Channel Knob and
Indicator. This knob is used to access 20 common preset channels that cannot be
changed from in the cockpit.

The Comm Function Selector Knob determines the current configuration of the
radio system.

- Horizontal Situation Indicator

The base intensity of all indicators is controlled with the Flight Instrument
Light knob on the Cockpit Light Control Panel.

## Formation and Indexer Lights Control Panel

![FormLights](../../img/FormLights.png)

Control of the formation lights, which are found on the wing tips, both sides of
the vertical stabilizer, and along the fuselage forward and amidship, is
performed using the three position switch and rotary knob on this panel. The
switch has positions for MOM (momentary), OFF, and ON. The variable control knob
provides relative illumination levels at five positions: OFF, DIM, MED (medium),
BRT (bright), and JOIN UP.

Also on this panel is the Indexer Lights brightness knob, which controls
relative illumination of the AoA indexers on both sides of the windscreen.
Marked positions are DIM and BRT (bright), with highest level to the right of
the knob.

## Circuit Breaker Panel

If a circuit breaker is popped, the corresponding system does not receive power
and cannot be operated anymore.

## Emergency Floodlights Panel

![PilFlood](../../img/PilFlood.png)

This auxiliary panel has various controls for lights and also audio.

### Stall Warning

The Stall Warning knob controls the volume of the AoA tones that play when
flying at certain angles.

Under certain conditions, the system can override the volume to ensure the cue
is always audible in dangerous situations.

### Standby AI

This knob used to control the brightness of the Standby Attitude Indicator (SAI)
lights, but has been replaced by the SAI Panel on the left wall.

### Instrument Flood

The three position switch controls the lamps illuminating the instrument panels
in both cockpits simultaneously in red light.

The bright and dim positions activate lamps powered by different electrical
buses to ensure the emergency light is available even in case of failure.

| Lamp   | Bus                  |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| Bright | Essential 28V DC Bus |
| Dim    | Left Main 14V AC Bus |

### ML Audio

pilot about being under attack.

## IFF Control Panel

![IFF](../../img/IFF.png)

## DCU-94A Stores Control-Monitor Panel

![DCU94](../../img/DCU94.png)

This panel is used to control and test the separate release circuit system for
nuclear stores.

Nuclear stores are separated from the regular release system to prevent
accidental release.

### Compass Control Panel

![CompassCtl](../../img/CompassCtl.png)

Manages essential controls for the proper operation of the AJB-7 azimuth system.
Essencial for accurate azimuth output to instruments like ADI, HSI, BDHI, but
also to the rear seat attitude indicator, autopilot, and bombing computer.

### Mode Selector Knob

Switches between different operating modes — Compass, DG (directional gyro), and
Slaved. It also has a spring-loaded SYNC position for fast synchronization of
the azimuth system basen on the compass flux valve signal.

| Name                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| COMP (Compass)        | Used in emergencies when the reference systems fail. Supplies magnetic heading directly from the flux valve                                                                                                                  |
| DG (Directional Gyro) | Used in extreme latitudes and regions with magnetic distortion, the initial magnetic heading needs manual adjustment. If the reference system is set to STBY, the aircraft's latitude must be adjusted on the latitude knob. |
| Slaved                | Primary operational mode under typical conditions, it depends on signals from the flux valve for a gradual synchronization of the system.                                                                                    |
| SYNC                  | Spring-loaded to return to SLAVED, facilitates fast synchronization between the compass flux valve and azimuth reference.                                                                                                    |

### Hemisphere Switch and Latitude Control Knob

Adjusted to set the aircraft's hemisphere and latitude in the DG Compass System
mode, when operating with the STBY reference system. The hemisphere is
determined by rotating the screw above the latitude knob. When the PRIM
reference system mode is active, setting a latitude other than zero will cause
errors by doubling drift compensation due to INS corrections.

### Set Heading Control Knob

Push-to-turn knob, spring-loaded to return to the center, permits manual
adjustment of the azimuth, crucial when operating in the DG mode.

### Sync Indicator

Displays the azimuth deviation between the flux valve signal and the internal
reference system.

## Exterior Lights Control Panel

![ExtLights](../../img/ExtLights.png)

This panel contains controls connected to most of the exterior lighting:

- 3 position lights (green, red, white)
- 2 wingtip join-up lights (green, red)
- 3 fuselage lights (white)
- anti-collision tail light with 2 lamps (red)

Three switches labelled Fuselage, Tail and Wing control brightness of the lights
between BRT (Bright), DIM and OFF.

To ensure lights are available even in case of power failure conditions, the BRT
and DIM selections are routed through different buses:

| Lamp       | Bus                   |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Bright     | Right Main 28V DC Bus |
| Dim        | Left Main 14V AC Bus  |
| Anti-Col 1 | Right Main 14V AC Bus |

Additionally, if set to BRT and and the Flasher Switch is set to FLASH, both
anti-collision lights illuminate.

### Tail Switch

Controls the position light on the tail.

### Wing Switch

Controls two of the three position and the two join-up lights on the wingtips.

### Flasher Switch

Can be set to OFF, STEADY or FLASH to additionally control the setting for:

- one of the two anti-collision lamps
- tail position light
- fuselage lights

If set to OFF, the controlled lights are OFF regardless of their respective
switches. In the STEADY position, they light up corresponding to the selected
brightness. The FLASH position lets the controlled lights phase from the set
brightness to a low brigthness and back.

## Emergency Vent Handle

![EmergVent](../../img/EmergVent.png)

A plug that can be pulled to release cockpit pressure. Putting it back in will
seal the cabin again.

Should only be used if the pressurization system is malfunctioning and reads
abnormal values. Descend to safe altitudes before activating.

## Cockpit Lighting Control Panel

![PilCockLights](../../img/PilCockLights.png)

The Cockpit Lighting Control Panel provides control of all panel edge lighting,
flight instrument panel lighting, the console floodlights, the white floodlights
found under the canopy sill over each console, and also includes the Warning
Light Test/Standby Compass Light switch.

The White Floodlight switch acts independent of all other controls on the panel,
and is either ON or OFF. It activates a separate emergency floodlight (also
called Thunderstorm Light) that illuminates the cockpit in white. The lamp is
energized through the Battery Bus to ensure it is always operational, even in
case of total power loss. Do not forget to turn off the light before parking the
aircraft for a longer time, as it will otherwise drain the battery.

The Flight Instrument Light Knob (marked INSTR PANEL), when moved to the right
of the OFF detent, controls illumination of the following six instrument lights
in unison:

- Airspeed/Mach Indicator
- Attitude Director Indicator
- Angle of Attack Indicator
- Vertical Velocity Indicator
- Altimeter
- Horizontal Situation Indicator

When in the OFF position, these indicators are independently controlled for
illumation by the knobs on the Flight Instrument Lights Intensity Panel.

The Console Light Control Knob, with range from OFF to BRT, controls
illumination level for all panel edge lighting and the console floodlights.

The console floodlights (CONSOLE FLOOD) are triggered independently of the knob
when it is placed to the right of the OFF detent position, and offer three
settings- DIM, MED, or BRT. The floodlights will remain on until the Console
Light Control knob is returned to the OFF position, and the floodlight switch is
placed in DIM. All three positions are powered by different buses to ensure
maximal availability:

| Lamp   | Bus                   |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| Bright | Essential 28V DC Bus  |
| Medium | Left Main 14V AC Bus  |
| Dim    | Left Main 115V AC Bus |

The Warning Light Test Switch (Marked WARN LT TEST) is a three-position switch;
in the WARN LT TEST position, confirms function of the various emergency
indicators in the cockpit. In the STBY COMP position, it illuminates the light
for the Standby Compass. Both functions are deactivated when the switch is
placed in the OFF position.

## Airborne Video Tape Recorder

![pilot_avtr](../../img/pilot_avtr.png)

The AVTR system is installed in the rear section to the right of the seat. It is
primarily controlled by the WSO and records the intercom sound, as well as the
rear radar screen.

Footage is recorded on a standard u-matic S cassette, which can be removed and
replaced using the EJECT Button on the top right of the box. The UNTHREAD button
next to it is used to unthread the tape of the cassette back to the start,
causing it to overwrite previously recorded footage.

The cassette can record up to 20 minutes, indicated on the small display
labelled ELAPSED TIME.

In DCS, footage is saved in the users Saved Games folder, for example:

`C:\Users\JohnDoe\Saved Games\DCS.openbeta\F-4E\recorders\avtr`

## Seat

### Seat Position

![pilot_seat_switch](../../img/pilot_seat_switch.png)

The vertical position of the seat can be changed in either direction for about
5cm using this spring-loaded switch.

Operation of the motor must be limited to 30 seconds within 10 minutes to
prevent it from overheating and breaking.
