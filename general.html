<p>The F-4E Phantom is powered by two J79-GE-17 engines built by General Electric, with a rated static sea-level power delivery of 11,870 pounds of thrust in Mil, and 17,900 pounds in afterburner.  The engines have provision for both assisted pneumatic start at fields with an available cart, or via a propellant cartridge to initiate spinup.   Similarly, the engines can utilize the aircraft’s internal battery for initial power, or connection with an external power cart.</p>
<div class="section" id="fuel-flow-indicators">
<h4>Fuel Flow Indicators<a class="headerlink" href="#fuel-flow-indicators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Each engine has a fuel flow indicator found in the front cockpit instrument panel.  The indicators read in thousands of pounds per hour, from 0 to 12.   The indicators provide flow rate up to Mil power; when afterburner is engaged, a separate fuel delivery system is used to provide fuel directly to the afterburner stage, and the flow rate is approximately 4 times the value shown.</p>

<div class="section" id="oil-pressure-indicators">
<h4>Oil Pressure Indicators<a class="headerlink" href="#oil-pressure-indicators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Oil pressure indicators are on the front cockpit pedestal panel, and are graduated from 0 to 10, and are presented in 10 lb increments.</p>

<p>Paired throttles are provided in both cockpits for engine thrust control.  In normal use, movement of the throttles from IDLE to OFF will perform fuel cutoff; to prevent inadvertent engine shutdown, a pair of finger lifts are provided to lock out the OFF position without performing this actuation.  Afterburner is attained by shifting the throttles outboard (left) at the MIL stop, then pushing them forward.</p>
<p>The rear cockpit throttles are connected to the front throttles in such a fashion that only the pilot can start the engines or enter the afterburner range; the WSO can reduce throttle out of the afterburner region back into MIL operation and lower.

<p>The F-4 carries two internal wing tanks, along with seven fuel cells down the length of the fuselage, with cell 1 resting just behind the aft cockpit, and the remaining cells numbered in order to the rear of the aircraft.  Cell 1 is the feed cell for the engines; cells 4 and 6 each carry a hydraulic and an electric transfer pump to supply fuel to cells 1 and 2.  The remaining fuselage cells perform gravity feed into 1, 4, or 6: cell 2 feeds cell 1, 3 feeds 4, and 5 and 7 feed 6.  With this arrangement, center of gravity balance is maintained along the centerline.  Cell 7 is the last cell to initiate transfer in the sequence, and does not begin until the total fuel in cells 1 and 2 fall below 1800 lbs.</p>
<p>Fuel transfer from the wing and external tanks is performed by bleed air pressurization once airborne; they will not transfer until the aircraft is off the ground.

<p>The Pitch channel provides a maximum control authority to the stability augmentation of one half degree (0.5) above or below the current pitch trim setting.</p>
<p>The Roll channel gives the stability augmentation 7.5 degrees of control of the ailerons, and up to 11 degrees of deflection to the spoilers.</p>
<p>The Yaw channel  permits augmentation up to 5 degrees left or right from the current rudder trim position.</p>
<p>Because the stability augmentation system can misinterpret roll oscillation in high AoA maneuvering and inadvertently invoke adverse roll, it is suggested to disable the Roll channel prior to aerobatics or combat to alleviate this possibility.</p>

<p>The Slats Flap system is manually selected for takeoff and landing, then automatically controlled relative to AoA for best handling performance in all other flight regimes.  Control is through a three position switch found outboard of the left throttle handle in the front cockpit and driven by the aircraft hydraulic system.  The three switch positions are Norm, Out, and Out and Down, and the resulting command can be moderated based on whether or not the landing gear being deployed.</p>
<p>Norm is the standard in-flight position, locking the Flaps and automatically programming the Slat deployment as a function of AoA.</p>
<p>Out deploys the Slats to their fully deployed position.  Should landing gear be deployed, both the Slats and Flaps will deploy.</p>
<p>Out and Down fully deploys both the Slats and the Flaps.  Should the landing gear not be down, the Wheels Light on the Telelight Panel will illuminate and flash.</p>
<p>Both cockpits have a Slats Flap Indicator, which read In and Out, along with a barberpole reading when the surfaces are in transition.</p>
<p>In the Norm position, Maneuvering Slat deployment is a function of AoA; above 11.5 units they will extend, then retract when the aircraft is reduced below 10.5 units.  Maneuvering Slat operation includes a speed-induced blowback; slats will retract due to air pressure between 568 to 602 knots.</p>
<p>To the rear of the Fuel Control Panel in the front cockpit is the Slat Override Switch.  Guarded, this switch has two positions: Norm and In.  Defaulted to Norm under the guard, switching to In forces retraction of the Slats no matter the current state of the aircraft- AoA or Slats Flap Switch position.  Actuating the Override will  give a SLATS IN warning on the Telelight Panel and illuminate Master Caution.</p>
<p>The Slats Flaps system also has an Emergency system; handles are found on the Slats Flaps control panel in the front cockpit, and next to the rear cockpit throttle pair.  The emergency system uses pneumatic pressure, and does not require electrical power to force deployment. The emergency system can only function once, and can be actuated at any airspeed; however, above 230 knots, the Flaps will retract based on air pressure, and the normal Slat retraction speeds also apply.</p>

The rate of the pulse can vary from 1.5 to 20 pulses per second, with increasing frequency based on higher AoA values.   This tone can be lowered below 20.3 units AoA gear down/25 units gear up with volume controls in each cockpit; exceeding these values will cause the system to override the volume limits and deliver the warning pulses at full volume.</p>

<h3>AN/ASN-63 Inertial Navigation System<a class="headerlink" href="#an-asn-63-inertial-navigation-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The AN/ASN-63 INS provides the F-4E aircrew and integrated weapons delivery system with real time accurate positional, velocity, and heading information. When the system is aligned to its most precise extent in gyrocompass mode, the INS is accurate to 3 nautical miles per hour of circular error probability (CEP).</p>
<p><strong>Inertial Measurement Platform</strong></p>
<p>The system uses a four gimbal (outer roll, pitch, inner roll, azimuth) inertial navigating platform, with the dual roll gimbals providing redundancy to eliminate a gimbal lock in outer roll/azimuth gimbal alignment.</p>
<p>Installed on the platform are a pair of G-200 two-axis gyros, with the upper gyro axis aligned for spin on the north-south axis  while the lower gyro aligns for east-west spin; torque detection in each gyro tracks the perpendicular axes- ergo, the high gimbal detects east/west rotation, while the low gyro detects north/south rotation.  In this way, rotation in all three dimensions are represented.  The gyros are floated, and proper operation can only take place once the fluid has attained operating temperature (160 degrees F); the system is effectively climate controlled across the altitude operating range of the Phantom. A series of precision magnetic torquers provide localization movement, while acceleration pickoffs function within a separate electromagnetic field perform the actual data capture from the displacements of the gyroscopes.</p>
<p>Along the platform, set orthogonally (at 90 degree respective positions) are a trio of A-200D accelerometers.  These accelerators, similarly floated to the gyros, with a similar arrangement of torquers and displacement pickers to provide velocity capture.  Increasing the accuracy of these evaluations is the inclusion of a tuning fork, the resonance from which eliminates effectively all static friction in the motion capture assembly.</p>
<p><strong>Navigational Computer and Output Signal Distribution</strong></p>
<p>The respective captured motion signals from the gyroscopes and accelerometers are amplified in the LN-12D navigational computer, which then performs the earth reference integration.  The LN-12D compensates for all longitudes and can effectively track as high as 80 degrees latitude, where the mechanical limitations of calculating tangent relative to the equator is too high for the device.</p>
<p>The AN/ASN-63 provides information to other systems in the Phantom from the OSDU, or Output Signal Distribution Unit.  The OSDU provides ground speed, north-south and east-west velocity, total velocity, inertially stabilized altitude, climb angle, true inertial heading, ground track, and drift angle.  The WRCS receives inertial true heading, ground track, drift correction angle, and drift angle for its ballistics computer.  Drift angle is captured for the BDHI, HSI, and FDC.  Drift correction angle is also provided to the radar and LCOSS.</p>

<p><strong>HEAT Lamp</strong></p>
<p>The HEAT lamp illuminates when the system is placed into STBY mode, and remains illuminated for 110 seconds after the gyros have reached operating temperature.  The system will not align if switched out of STBY before this lamp has shut off.</p>
<p><strong>ALIGN Lamp</strong></p>
<p>The ALIGN lamp provides current INS alignment through illuminating steady (BATH or HDG MEM alignment complete), or flashing at the completion of GYRO COMP alignment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="alignment-options">
<h4>Alignment Options<a class="headerlink" href="#alignment-options" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The LN-12 has three modes of alignment on aircraft start: BATH, Heading Memory (HDG MEM), and Gyrocompass aignment.  Prior to performing any alignment, with the mode knob in STBY, the position update switch on the Nav Computer Control Panel should be selected to NORMAL, local magnetic variation should be entered on the variation counter, and the position counter should be set to local latitude and longitude.  Doing so will greatly expedite gyrocompass alignment.  Further, alignment should not be performed with the wings in their folded position, as the magnetic flux valve that provides compass synchronization wil be 60 degrees outside of normal position.</p>
<p>The INS also includes an in-flight alignment update option, should the aircrew note gross deviation from known location fixes.</p>
<p><strong>Best Available True Heading</strong></p>
<p>Once set to ALIGN, the BATH lamp will illuminate after 75 seconds.  Once in BATH, the INS is accurate to roughly 5 and a half nautical miles per hour CEP, although higher inaccuracies can be seen.  Once BATH is achieved, NAV mode can be selected and the aircraft flown with the above caveat.</p>
<p><strong>Heading Memory Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Accessed by selecting HDG MEM, this alignment method provides minimum alignment time with a relative CEP at the best end of BATH (5.5 nmi) by using a previously stored alignment .  Beneath the red guard on the control panel is the HDG MEM/GYRO COMP switch.</p>
<p>To access the accelerated HDG MEM alignment mode, the guard must be raised and the switch actuated up, and the INS mode switch placed to ALIGN until the ALIGN lamp illuminates.  Once the lamp is lit, the INS can be placed into NAV mode.  If time allows, STBY mode can be selected to allow proper heating of the gyroscopes (which goes through the illumination/off cycle as above).  Any other available time prior to moving the aircraft can be spent in ALIGN to further increase system accuracy.</p>
<p>When HDG MEM mode alignment is complete, the guard should be closed placing the switch back into GYRO COMP once NAV mode has been selected for the INS.</p>
<p><strong>Gyrocompass Alignment</strong></p>
<p>Maximum system precision is found by allowing the INS to perform a full Gyrocompassing alignment.  This method permits the gyros to find the most accurate true north reference possible, but can entail substantial amounts of time- and even greater time based on inaccurate or missing magnetic variation setting entry prior to powering the INS on.  As an example- for a one degree compass heading error, the time to achieve maximum accuracy on the system is approximately five minutes, which attains an accuracy of +/- 10 minutes of arc alignment, giving the aforementioned 3 nautical miles of deviation per hour.  The minimum amount of time to complete a Gyrocompassing alignment once BATH or HDG MEM level alignment is achieved is 50 additional seconds, while a normal alignment takes around 5 minutes.  If the aircraft is aligned at 70 degrees of latitude or more, additional time should be expected.</p>
<p>Once Gyrocompass alignment is complete, the ALIGN indicator will flash, indicating the system is now at full alignment.  NAV mode on the INS can be entered at any time during gyrocompassing, but best accuracy will not be attained until the ALIGN indicator flashes.</p>

<h4>In-Flight Alignment<a class="headerlink" href="#in-flight-alignment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In the event of substantial latitude/longitude error versus a known radar or visual location fix, the aircraft should be flown straight and level, with the Reference System Selector Knob in STBY.  Once done, the INS Mode Knob should be selected to OFF, then to STBY for 15 seconds.  After 15 seconds, the Mode should be returned to NAV, and the Reference Selector back to PRIM.</p>

<h4>Navigation Computer<a class="headerlink" href="#navigation-computer" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The ASN-46A Nav Computer is used for general navigation and tactical route planning.  The system contains both a great circle and rhumb line computational capabilities, with the former being used for larger distance bearing calculations (over 120 miles), and the latter for closer range accuracy.  The Nav Computer functions solely using aircraft-based instruments, ergo the INS, Air Data Computer, and the magnetic compass; it can receive no information from the ILS, VOR, or TACAN systems.</p>
<p>The system can maintain relative bearing and distance from up to two specific waypoints at a time (identified as Target 1 and Target 2, with Target 2 being held in memory), and this information is shown on the BDHI and ADI in real time.  For data to appear on the BDHI, the Navigation Selection Switch must be positioned in NAV COMP.</p>
<p>The computer also provides confirmation of current LN-12 precision, using a pair of lights marked LAT and LONG, as well as the Variation Sync Meter.  When these lamps are off, the current displayed position coordinates are within 1 1/2 arc minutes precision.  Magnetic variation detected by way of the INS gyroscopes is compared against the manual performed prior to INS powerup via the Magnetic Variation Control knob, and displayed on the Variation Sync Meter.  This deviation can be corrected on the Magnetic Variation Control Knob to bring the sync to center.  Although the magnetic variation control knob has no effect on the meter in air data mode, positive correction prior to INS loss increases the air data mode precision.</p>
<p>The Nav Computer can function in either Inertial or Air Data mode.  Inertial mode is the default, meaning that cockpit indicators will provide range and bearing as well as ground track and heading using the flight instruments.</p>
<p>In the event of an INS failure, the Nav Computer reverts to  Air Data mode.  In Air Data mode. the rear pilot must continually monitor and adjust true wind direction and speed, magnetic variation, and target waypoint coordinates, as the only dead reckoning inputs available to the computer is true airspeed (from the air data computer) and magnetic heading from the compass system.  When the system reverts to Air Data mode, the AIR DATA MODE lamp will illuminate.</p>
<p>During startup, the Position Control Knobs, Wind Control Knobs, and Magnetic Variation Control Knob are used to enter known latitude, longitude, wind direction and speed, and magnetic variation for the location of the aircraft at that time.</p>

<p>Because of the Target 2 memory function, in practice the aircrew has some flexibility in process depending on the demands of the mission.  As an example, should the Phantom crew be tasked with a CAP or defensive role relative to a known position (ie, bullseye), the coordinates of that location can be loaded into the Target Control values, the Function Selector placed into RESET, and then returned to Target 2.  Any change from Target 2 to Target 1 or STBY, then back to Target 2 will maintain said location value, easily accessed.</p>
<p>The other common technique was “leapfrogging”:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>On startup, the second waypoint would be stored in Target 2 memory (entry on the Target Control values, Function to RESET, then back to Target 2).</p></li>
<li><p>Once the second waypoint location was stored, the rear pilot would then select Target 1 for live entry of the first in-flight waypoint on the Target Control values.</p></li>
<li><p>During flyout to the first waypoint, upon passing it over, Target 2 would be selected as the destination, and the next waypoint (3) would be entered on the Target Control Values.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon flyover of waypoint 2, the Function Knob would be positioned to RESET, then back to Target 2- now pulling the waypoint 3 values from the Target Control values.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This process would be continued over the course of the flight, and allow the rear pilot the ability to immediately switch to Target 1 for a quick check of relative position to another location of interest if required, or an in-flight detour (such as to a tanker track), then return back to the next stored waypoint for navigation.</p>

<div class="section" id="in-flight-updating">
<h4>In Flight Updating<a class="headerlink" href="#in-flight-updating" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>In flight updating with the Nav Computer is performed using direct overflight of known target points, using a visual or radar fix, over a TACAN station, or via instruction from GCI.</p>
<p><strong>Inertial Mode Update</strong></p>
<p>With the Nav Computer in Inertial mode, the aircraft is flown straight and level at a known fix location.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>On arrival, the Position Update Switch is placed in the SET position.  Doing so disengages the longitude and latitude position counters.</p></li>
<li><p>The position longitude and latitude counters are set using their respective knobs for the know location.</p></li>
<li><p>Prior to arrival at the fix point, the Position Update Switch is placed and held in the FIX position.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon direct flyover of the fix point, the Position Update Switch is released, allowing it to fall back into NORMAL.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The correction rate of the Nav Computer is roughly 3 minutes latitude or longitude per second, and the Update Switch must be held in FIX long enough to account for the largest value. As an example, if the deviation is 9 minutes in latitude and 4 in longitude, the FIX position must be held at least 3 seconds prior to the aircraft directly passing the fix location.  Further, the switch actuation from SET to FIX must be smooth and direct, as there is a half second time delay in the computer in the pass-through of NORMAL.</p>
<p><strong>Air Data Mode Update</strong></p>
<p>In Air Data Mode, the Nav Computer can be updated as in the Inertial Mode using the SET/FIX method, or via direct rotation of the latitude and longitude position knobs.  Using the latter method requires the Function Select Knob to be placed in STBY, TARGET 1, or TARGET 2. The SET/FIX method is preferred, as doing so allows for instant update upon fix position flyover and release of the switch.</p>

<h3>TACAN (Tactical Air Navigation) System<a class="headerlink" href="#tacan-tactical-air-navigation-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Bearing and range information to transmitting stations is provided by the TACAN system.  The TACAN system can receive information from ground stations as far as 390 miles, and air to air TACAN equipped aircraft to 200 miles.  The TACAN system provides the identity of the transmitting station and the dependability of the signal received. Course deviation is calculated and displayed on navigation systems set in TACAN mode.  If a TACAN signal is invalid, a warning is displayed. In the event of a signal loss, the system continues providing range tracking for 15 seconds, and bearing tracking for 3 seconds.  The system will perform a self-test after a signal loss to confirm function on the control panel. Two TACAN antennas are provided, and signal switching is automatic to maintain the best signal.</p>
<div class="section" id="tacan-controls">

<p>The NAV CMD button and indicator performs command authority switch between the two cockpits, and are found on the upper right corner of the Communication Control Panel.  A green light illuminates to the left of the button in the cockpit that has control of the navigation system.</p>
<p><strong>Mode Selector Knob, BRG/DIST Selector Switch, and Navigation Function Selector</strong></p>
<p>As detailed in the Flight Director Group section, the Mode Selector, BRG/DIST Selector, and Navigation Function Selector determine the presentation of TACAN information on the HSI, the ADI, and the BDHI.</p>
<p><strong>Navigation Channel Control Knobs</strong></p>
<p>On the TACAN Control Panel beneath the channel window, a pair of knobs set the desired TACAN channel.  The left knob controls the tens and hundred digits of the channel.  The right knob selects the units of the operating channel, and the outer knob sets the X or Y channel; both X and Y have 126 available channels.  While the indicator can show 127, 128, and 129, these values are nonfunctional.</p>
<p><strong>TACAN Function Selector Knob</strong></p>
<p>OFF: the TACAN system is deenergized</p>
<p>REC: only the receiver is energized, and the system receives and decodes bearing signals from the TACAN station and provides bearing information for the HSI, BDHI, and ADI displays.</p>
<p>T/R: the TACAN generates distance information along with bearing; the distance is then added to the HSI and BDHI, provided in nautical miles.</p>
<p>A/A REC: the TACAN receives and displays bearing information for the HSI, BDHI, and ADI steering display from an aircraft providing a TACAN beacon signal.  The channel selected must be 63 channels above or below the transmitting aircraft beacon, on the same X or Y channel range; for example, a tanker transmitting on 83X will be received on 20X.</p>
<p>A/A TR: the TACAN interrogates the equipped aircraft beacon to add range information to the HSI and BDHI.  The channel selection method remains the same as A/A REC.</p>

<h3>Ejection Seats<a class="headerlink" href="#ejection-seats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Phantom II uses the Martin Baker Mk. H-7 ejection seat in both positions for safe aircrew extraction in the event of airframe loss.  Triggering ejection using the face curtain or lower ejection handles fires the seat mounted initiator that jettisons the canopy.  Once the canopy is clear of the airframe, the ejection gun primary charge fires, unlatching the seat from the cockpit and initiating seat climbout.  As the seat rises, restraints on the legs pull them back for clearance and the drogue timer is set.  At the appropriate height, a lanyard attaching the rocket motor initiator to the airframe trips the firing pin for the main rocket engine to clear the aircraft. The previously set drogue gun fires at this time, deploying a pair of small chutes to stabilize the seat in attitude and initiate deceleration.</p>
<p>Once the seat has reached a pre-set barometric altitude between 11,500 and 14,500 feet, or momentarily after stabilization if lower, scissor mechanisms release the crewmember with the survival kit-containing seat pan from the ejection frame and deploys the main chute. In the event of ejection below the barostat altitude, the WSO chute is fully deployed at 5 seconds after ejection initiation, and the pilot one second later.</p>

<h3>Air Refueling System<a class="headerlink" href="#air-refueling-system" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For air to air refueling, the F-4E uses a receptacle system compatible with high pressure USAF-style boom refueling.  With this system, fuel can be delivered to the Phantom at a rate of up to 3900 lbs per minute.   Fuel received is delivered into fuselage cell 2, then equalized through the rest of the aircraft cells, wing tanks, and, if installed and selected, external tanks.</p>
<div class="section" id="air-refuel-switch">
<h4>Air Refuel Switch<a class="headerlink" href="#air-refuel-switch" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Preparation for air refueling is performed by toggling the Air Refuel Switch to EXTEND; doing so extends the receptacle, illuminates the receptacle visual lamps, depressurizes the fuel cells, activates the transfer pumps to redistribute received fuel for CG maintenance, and activates the air refuel READY lamp.

<h3>Aircraft Weapons Release Unit<a class="headerlink" href="#aircraft-weapons-release-unit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Used in the BOMBS and RKTS &amp; DISP weapon modes, the AWRU provides interval and quantity controls for munition delivery.  The AWRU has both a manual and automatic mode, and the resulting function is accessed with the appropriate settings.</p>
<p>The Interval Knob contains 14 values, providing base interval timing of release pulses while the bomb release button is held from 1/20th of a second (.05) to 1 second.  This value can have a 10x multiplier applied to it using the INTRVL Switch.  In the NORM mode of the INTRVL switch, the release will apply as on the Interval Knob, whereas when selected to x10, the 10x multiplier will apply- for example, 1 second in NORM would become an interval of 10 seconds in x10 mode.</p>
<p>The Quantity Knob sets the total number of munitions dropped during a bomb release hold, and applies the manual or automatic release functions based on the value selected.</p>
<p><strong>Single-Manual: 1</strong></p>
<p>In the 1 position, the AWRU is placed into manual mode.  One munition will be dropped on each bomb release press, with releases across multiple selected stations dropping in a left-right-left pattern.  The bomb release button must be released, then pressed a subsequent time, to release another round.</p>
<p><strong>Single-Ripple: 2-18</strong></p>
<p>In numerical positions 2-18, up to the total number of selected munitions will be dropped according to the Interval setting.  As an example, with a QTY of 6 and an interval of .20, six bombs will be dropped, one every 2/10ths of a second from the press of the bomb release button.  The sequence will reset upon button release, allowing subsequent ripples of the same quantity to be dropped.</p>
<p><strong>Single-Continuous: C</strong></p>
<p>In position C, the quantity of weapons is dictated by how long the bomb release button is held.  The ripple will apply the set interval, releasing one munition each pulse, until the bomb button is released.</p>
<p><strong>Pairs-Manual: P</strong></p>
<p>Position P places the AWRU into pairs mode.  With multiple stations selected, each time the bomb button is pressed, a weapon will be released from each station.</p>
<p><strong>Salvo: S</strong></p>
<p>In the S position, the AWRU enters into salvo mode, functioning like Pairs-Manual with single rounds released from each station, but using the set interval value to release multiple salvos until the bomb button is released.</p>

<h3>Weapon Release Computer Set (WRCS)<a class="headerlink" href="#weapon-release-computer-set-wrcs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Provision for the F-4E to perform accurate level and dive munition delivery is provided by the AN/ASQ-91 WRCS. The WRCS inputs are set with the associated panels in the cockpits, and these commands, along with INS data and radar target ranging, are used by the ballistic computer to provide the release signal.</p>
<div class="section" id="target-range-controls">
<h4>Target Range Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#target-range-controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Computer Control Panel found in the rear cocpit has three TARGET entry controls, two RELEASE entries, and a bomb DRAG COEFFICIENT entry setting, as well as a BIT control knob for system function check.  Target entry is relative to the predetermined IP.</p>
<p>The upper range control input is for North/South, and selection of relative bearing is noted by the N or S prefix at the start.</p>
<p>The middle range control input is for East/West, and like the previous, the E or W prefix on the range sets the relative bearing direction.</p>
<p>The final ALT RANGE entry is for target altitude- whether the target or RIP (Radar Identification Point) elevation as MSL, or the target/RIP’s pressure altitude.</p>
<p>Entries for North/South and East/West are in 100 foot increments, and a maximum value of up to 99,900 feet may be entered for these distances.  The ALT RANGE entry has a maximum of 24,900 in 100 foot increments.  Note that the WRCS can be damaged if the ALT RANGE entry is greater than the aircraft’s current MSL (x100) in TGT FIND and OFFSET BOMB modes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="release-range-control">
<h4>Release Range Control<a class="headerlink" href="#release-range-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Release Range control is used to manually set bomb range in tens of feet, and is accessible in the Laydown, Dive Laydown, and Offset Bombing modes. The maximum setting is 9990 feet (999x10), and when used in a WRCS/AJB-7 integrated delivery, the actual range can be as high as 99,900’.</p>
<p>The Rg control should not be set to the same value as the target range control.  Otherwise, the bomb rack delay may may relase late, or not at all.</p>

<h4>Release Advance Control<a class="headerlink" href="#release-advance-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Operative in all WRCS and WRCS/LABS integrated motes, the Release Advance Control works in conjunction with the AWRU to advance the release signal in milliseconds.  Whereas the AWRU Intervalometer setting triggers the release pulse sequence from the moment the bomb release button is pressed, when the Release Advance Control is applied in a WRCS driven delivery, the specific bomb location in a multiple ripple sequence can be calculated in advance, allowing the most effective spread possible across a given target.</p>
<p>As an example, an AWRU single-ripple quantity release of 4 is selected with an interval of 120 miliseconds.  To place the third bomb in the ripple on target, the following equation is used:</p>
<p>RA = I<sub>R</sub>(N<sub>Tgt</sub>-1)</p>
<p>where</p>
<p>RA = Release Advance Setting, milliseconds</p>
<p>I<sub>R</sub>= ARWU Release Intervalometer setting, milliseconds</p>
<p>N<sub>Tgt</sub>= Impact Sequence number of bomb desired on target</p>
<p>RA = 120(3-1)</p>
<p>Thus, for this release, we would set the value of RA to 240 msec. This would produce a spread of two bombs ahead of target, one on the calculated target point, and one behind.</p>
<p>The maximum setting for the Release Advance Control is 999 milliseconds.</p>

<div class="section" id="drag-coefficient-control">
<h4>Drag Coefficient Control<a class="headerlink" href="#drag-coefficient-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Used only in the Dive Toss Mode, this entry is a bias factor prepared for the ballistic computer to compensate for actual bomb trajectory.  The maximum setting for this value is 9.99.</p>
<p><strong>Ballistic Computer</strong></p>
<p>The ballistic computer is not directly accessed by the flight crew, but instead pre-set based on the configured loadout by the ground crew to add the necessary ejection bias factors.  The computer uses these pre-set bias factors in conjunction with a coeficient setting for munition drag in the Dive Toss mode to calculate accurate delivery.</p>

<div class="section" id="cursor-control-panel">
<h4>Cursor Control Panel<a class="headerlink" href="#cursor-control-panel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Cursor Control Panel provides the controls needed for TARGET FIND and OFFSET bombing modes.  The panel has two thumbwheels named ALONG TRACK and CROSS TRACK, which is used in the MAP-PPI mode to position their respective cursors over the Radar Identification Point (from this point denoted as RIP).  The ALONG TRACK control, which presents relative range to the RIP, also includes an internal switch enabling the cursor instructions to be acknowledged by the WRCS ballistic computer, and must therefore be the first applied command in the target insertion sequence.</p>
<p>Once the ALONG TRACK (range hemisphere) and CROSS TRACK (vertical line) cursors are aligned over the RIP, the FREEZE button is pressed to initiate WRCS ground path tracking of the specified point.  The button remains illuminated until the RESET button is pressed or another bombing mode is selected.</p>
<p>With WRCS ground tracking initiated, the TARGET INSERT button is pressed for the ALONG TRACK and CROSS TRACK cursors to shift from the RIP to the offset target.  Once selected, target steering information is provided from the WRCS to the BDHI, ADI, HSI, and optical sight.  In the AGM-45 missile mode, the AoA Indexers will provide maneuver commands for level, dive, or climb requirements to align for seeker acquisition.  Further, unless the WRCS Tone switch is disabled on the ARBCS panel, an audio tone will be triggered from the point of bomb release button press until the first bomb releases from the aircraft; this function is nominally for training purposes, as it can preclude other system audio volume.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="weapon-delivery-panel">
<h4>Weapon Delivery Panel<a class="headerlink" href="#weapon-delivery-panel" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Weapon Delivery Panel permits the aircrew to use the WRCS TGT FIND functions in LABS (ARBCS) modes- those found on the left side of the pilot’s Delivery Mode Knob.</p>
<p>The TGT FIND switch on the panel functions the same as the TGT FIND mode on the Delivery Mode Knob.  The Delivery Mode Knob overrides this switch in any mode outside of TGT FIND, and should be set back to NORM.  The HOLD position energizes the target finding circuts in conjunction with any LABS or DIRECT mode the pilot selects.</p>
<p>The RANGE Switch is functional in any WRCS mode requiring a Release Range setting.  The NORM position applies the noted x10 multiplier on the displayed Release setting, whereas selecting x100 applies a multiplier of 100 to the counter value.</p>
<p>The ACTIVATE Switch triggers the prerequisite activation signals to the LABS circuits once the aircraft has passed within the Release Range.  The switch should only be placed in ON after target insert has been pressed and the ALONG TRACK and CROSS TRACK cursors have transitioned to the target.</p>

<p>The AN/AJB-7 ARBCS is the automated release control system for time or pitch-relative bombing.  Interfacing wihth the Multiple Weapon Controls, Pedestal Panel weapon settings, and bomb, laser guided, or the AGM-45, the system releases the selected munition once the respective Bombing Timer or respective Bomb Release Angle Computer pitch angle (gyro) target has been achieved.</p>
<p>The left side of the Delivery Mode Knob selects the ARBCS release modes. Both LOFT and T LAD modes provide weapons release in a pull-up, with LOFT selecting a 4.0 G pullup schedule and weapon release on achieving a set gyro angle value, whereas T LAD assumes a 3.5 G pullup schedule and release at the end of the Bombing Timer setting.  Necessary values for Low and High angle, as well as the Bombing Timer are found on the provided tables.</p>

<h4>Bombing Timers<a class="headerlink" href="#bombing-timers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Timers for ARBCS bombing modes are available for PULLUP (0 to 60 seconds) and RELEASE (0 to 30 seconds).  Both can be set in increments of 0.1 second, with 0.1 second as the minimum setting.  The reference windows do not count down during the bomb run.</p>
<p>When the PULLUP timer is complete, required PULLUP signaling will initiate, along with any ADI director programming to show proper flight path.  RELEASE timing is mode dependent, and will occur once PULLUP is complete, if required.</p>
<p>In LOFT and O/S modes, only PULLUP timing is activated, and a value must be set to energize the ADI pullup flight path program.</p>
<p>In T LAD and TL, PULLUP and RELEASE are both activated, in sequence, and both require a value entry- PULLUP to energize the flight path programming, and RELEASE to generate the munition release signal.</p>
<p>In integrated LABS (ARBCS)/WRCS bombing, the above requirements are the same, however the WRCS initiates the bomb run timing, rather than pressing the bomb button.  When the WRCS initiates timing, a audio tone is applied to signal timer start.</p>

<h4>ARBCS Indicators<a class="headerlink" href="#arbcs-indicators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>During ARBCS weapons delivery, a number of indicators are available to confirm run initiation and at what step of the given run the aircraft is in:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Upon run initiation (bomb button press/WRCS initiation) and PULLUP timer start, the Pullup light turns ON.</p></li>
<li><p>At PULLUP timer completion, the Pullup light turns OFF, the reticle light turns OFF, and a steady Pullup Tone (if switched ON) occurs.</p></li>
<li><p>As release pitch angle is attained, the Pullup light turns ON, the reticle light turns ON, and the Pullup Tone stops.</p></li>
<li><p>When the bomb button is released, Pullup light turns OFF.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This indication sequence can occur with the master arm in SAFE for training purposes.</p>

<h4>Gyro Fast Erect<a class="headerlink" href="#gyro-fast-erect" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Due to rapid maneuvering during a bombing run, gyro deviation can occur due to fluid migration. While this deviation will resolve naturally at a rate of 1 to 2 degrees correction perminute over time, it can quickly be corrected by using the FAST ERECT switch found in the front pilot cockpit on the left side console, at a rate of 15 degrees per minute.  This switch should not be held for more than 60 seconds, or damage can occur to the gyro.</p>

<h3>Pave Spike<a class="headerlink" href="#pave-spike" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The AN/AVQ-23 Pave Spike targeting pod is the successor of the AN/AVQ-10 Pave Knife and predecessor of the AN/AVQ-26 Pave Tack pod. It entered service in 1974 and was replaced from 1982 to 1989 by the Pave Tack pod.  It provides a slewable TV image for spotting ground targets and can fire laser for determining range information and to guide laser guided weapons.</p>
<p>The line of sight can be controlled by the WSO, using the Antenna Hand Control.  The camera image is displayed on the DSCG scope and can be viewed by both, the Pilot and the WSO independently.</p>
<div class="section" id="targeting-pod">
<h4>Targeting Pod<a class="headerlink" href="#targeting-pod" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The system has an optical camera for daylight operation with one level of optical zoom, for a wide and narrow (4x) field of view.</p>
<p>Limitations for the pods gimbals are</p>
<p>Roll: -160 to +110 degrees
Pitch: -160 to +15 degrees
Yaw: -15 to +15 degrees</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="symbology">
<h4>Symbology<a class="headerlink" href="#symbology" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The TV image mainly consists of a reticle. The reticle rotates clockwise to indicate the pods current elevation. At a 90degree rotation, the pod is looking straight down. If the reticle is almost upside down, the pod reached its gimbal limit for the elevation (160 degrees).</p>
<p>The wide field of view is indicated by a circle around the reticle.</p>
<p>On the left, the image displays two cues:</p>
<p>Time To Go Cue (TTg)
Release Cue (T0)</p>
<p>During weapon operation, TTg moves down until it intersects T0, indicating the time to release.</p>
<p>The cues also indicate various situations related to laser operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="controls">
<h4>Controls<a class="headerlink" href="#controls" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The Pave Spike is mostly interacted with by the WSO, while the Pilot has indicators assisting in keeping the pods line of sight within its limits. The entire system, known as AN/ASQ-153 Electro-Optical Target Designator System, consists of:</p>
<p>Range Indicator (Pilot)</p>
<p>Azimuth-Elevation Indicator (Pilot)</p>
<p>Laser Coder Control (WSO)</p>
<p>Target Designator Set Control (WSO)</p>
<p>While the display is shown on the DSCG screens in both cockpits.</p>
<p>Azimuth-Elevation Indicator</p>
<p>The Azimuth-Elevation Indicator is the main instrument for the pilot to assess the pods current attitude in order to keep the line of sight within the operational limits.</p>
<p>The needle shows the pods roll position from -160 (CW) to +110 (CCW) degrees.</p>
<p>Three flags indicate the elevation:</p>
<p>green: -120 to -155 degrees</p>
<p>yellow: -155 to -160 degrees</p>
<p>red: -160 or beyond degrees</p>
<p>If the needle is kept within the green labelled range and no, or only the green flag are shown, the view will not be obstructed by the pod or the aircraft.</p>
<p>Range Indicator</p>
<p>This panel provides the pilot with a readout of the slant range measured by the Pave Spike (x100 ft).</p>
<p>When the Test-Button is pressed, the display shows 888, the knob underneath it controls the brightness of the readout.
The Mode-Knob allows the pilot to select one of two weapon delivery modes available with the pod:</p>
<p>WRCS - Automatic Delivery</p>
<p>ROR - Release on Range</p>
<p>In the SET position, the display shows the desired release range used in the ROR mode. The knob below the readout can be used to adjust this range.</p>
<p>Laser Coder Control</p>
<p>The WSO can set the laser code used by the targeting pod by using the four small push-buttons on this panel. Each press will advance the corresponding digit by one. Once a code has been set, it can be transferred to the Pave Spike by pressing the Enter-Button to the right.</p>
<p>The Laser Coder system starts validating the entered code, this process takes about 5 seconds. If the NO-GO lamp is lit, the code is invalid.</p>
<p>Codes directly relate to lasers frequencies, resulting in them having to be between 1111 and 1788 and not use digits 0 or 9 in order to be valid.</p>
<p>When power is applied to the system, it automatically initiates a transfer of the currently set code.</p>
<p>Target Designator Control Set</p>
<p>This is the main panel to interact with the targeting pod.</p>
<p>From left to right, top to bottom, it provides the WSO with:</p>
<p>Reticle Brightness Knob - change the reticle from black to green</p>
<p>Az/El/Roll Boresight Knobs - adjust the boresight position of the pod within +/-2.5 degrees</p>
<p>Stow Button - Stow or Unstow the pod</p>
<p>Laser Ready Button - Arm or Disarm the laser</p>
<p>Power On Button - Turn the pod on or off</p>
<p>Currently selected BIT, with push button to advance the BIT</p>
<p>Light Brightness Knob - adjust brightness of all lights on this panel (except the Overheat lamp)</p>
<p>Reject/Override Button - Force the use of the laser slant range</p>
<p>Acquisition Mode Switch - Select the Acquisition Mode (12-VIS, WRCS or 9-VIS)</p>
<p>WRCS Out Button - Toggle WRCS integration with the pod</p>
<p>GO/MALF Lamp - Indicates BIT results</p>
<p>INS Out Button (and Overheat lamp) - Toggle INS integration with the pod</p>
<p>The lamps generally indicate the current status, while the push buttons can be used as a manual command. For example, pressing the Laser Ready Button is not enough for the laser to actually be ready. The lamp will only be lit if all other conditions, such as a valid laser code being set, are met.</p>
<p>Antenna Hand Control</p>
<p>During Track mode, the WSO can manually slew and correct the pods line of sight with the Antenna Hand Control, or Antenna Stick.</p>
<p>The Challenge Button is used to zoom in or out, while the 2-stage trigger is used to switch between modes and fire the laser.</p>
<p>Electrics</p>
<p>The Pave Spike draws its power through 4 circuit breakers on the No. 4 CB Panel (WSO, left wall). They forward current from the left main AC bus and the main DC bus.</p>
<p>All panels of the system are powered directly through the pod, and hence will be turned off if the Pave Spike targeting pod is not equipped.</p>
<p>It is not required to turn on the pod itself in order for power to be routed through the pod to the panels.</p>
<p>INS integration</p>
<p>During normal operation, the pod is connected with the INS. This can be disabled manually by pressing the INS OUT push button.</p>
<p>With INS disabled, the following functions are not available:</p>
<p>Automatic target stabilization during Track-mode</p>
<p>Roll-stabilization during 12-VIS Acquisition-mode</p>
<p>Slant range computation</p>
<p>WRCS integration</p>
<p>During normal operation, the pod is connected with the WRCS. This can be disabled manually by pressing the WRCS OUT push button.</p>
<p>Also, the WRCS is disabled automatically without INS integration, or if currently not in DIRECT or TGT FIND weapon mode.</p>
<p>With WRCS disabled, the following functions are not available:</p>
<p>WRCS Acquisition mode</p>
<p>Memory mode</p>
<p>WRCS Automatic Weapon Release</p>
<p>And some functions are degraded, but still available:</p>
<p>Slant range computation</p>
<p>Automatic target stabilization during Track-mode</p>
<p>Modes</p>
<p>Prior to being able to designate a target, one has to visually aquire the general target area and put the LOS in the vicinity. This is done by using one of three acquisition modes:</p>
<p>12-VIS</p>
<p>9-VIS</p>
<p>WRCS</p>
<p>The modes can be selected by the WSO, using the Acquisition Mode Switch.</p>
<p>Visual modes</p>
<p>In 12-VIS and 9-VIS, the LOS is set to a fix position.</p>
<p>12-VIS: 0 roll, -2 elevation, looking slightly nose down</p>
<p>9-VIS: -90 roll (CW), -90 elevation (down), looking left</p>
<p>12-VIS can be a great way to find targets of opportunity, as it allows the pilot to put a target directly on the nose. The position also corresponds to the caged HUD reticle. Additionally, if the INS is integrated with the pod, 12-VIS is roll-stabilized.</p>
<p>The use of 9-VIS is very limited. It is intended to aid in acquiring a target while observing an area in a turn. The target has to be put on the extension of the left wing. However, in practice it is very difficult to maintain a turn in such an attitude.</p>
<p>WRCS mode</p>
<p>The main mode to acquire targets is the WRCS mode, in which the LOS is set to the current WRCS target. This usually corresponds to the cursor on the radar screen,but can also be set manually by the WSO. This enables the crew to spot a target, or general target area, by using the radar or entering known coordinates and then slewing the pod to this destination. If no specific target has been inserted, the WRCS usually defaults to the aircraft position, resulting in the pod looking straight down.</p>
<p>The WRCS mode automatically falls back to the 12-VIS mode in case the WRCS integration is deactivated.</p>
<p>Track mode</p>
<p>Once the target, or general target area, has been found using the acquisition modes, the WSO can enter Track-mode by pressing the trigger on the Antenna Hand Control to either Half or Full Action.</p>
<p>In this mode, the Antenna Stick can be moved to slew the pod LOS. Operating the laser is only available in this mode, and can be activated by pressing the trigger on the Antenna Stick to Full Action.</p>
<p>Track mode is indicated by the T0 and TTG cues becoming visible on the display. They also indicate the status during laser operation. If the INS is integrated with the pod, the image will automatically be space stabilized on the computed target position. Be aware that the stabilization is rudimentary and needs constant correction with the stick for the target to be kept centered.</p>
<p>The stabilization is mostly based on the measured slant range. Accurate slant range can be obtained by firing the laser. Alternatively, it is computed based on the aircraft barometric altitude and the target altitude, which can be set by the WSO on the WRCS panel.</p>
<p>Without a WRCS integration, a target altitude of 0 is assumed, degrading the stabilization.</p>
<p>Note that the pod is not capable of computing a slant range for targets above the own aircraft altitude (for example when attacking up-hill). Since that is measured using the barometric altitude, depending on the pressure-setting, this can lead to erratic behavior during hot days when flying low. Problematic situations like this were commonly referred to as Idiot mode, as the tracking system started to behave very odd and it was very difficult to restore proper behavior. The crew often had to deactivate the INS integration temporarily in order to disable the automatic tracking.</p>
<p>Memory Mode</p>
<p>Whenever a target-insert signal is send, the system activates the Memory-mode, provided it is currently in Track-mode and the WRCS integration is active.</p>
<p>In this mode, the line of sight is slaved to the current WRCS target, even if it is outside of the pods gimbal limits and cannot be displayed currently. The mode acts very similar to the WRCS-Acquisition mode.</p>
<p>The memory mode has to be left explicitly again, by either pressing half or full action on the Antenna Stick.</p>
<p>Target Insert</p>
<p>A target-insert signal is usually initiated by the WSO pressing the target-insert button. However, when the pod is currently in Track-mode and is maneuvered outside of its gimbal limits, it will automatically initiate a target-insert signal and send its current target position to the WRCS. Note that, if the laser is currently firing, it will automatically be stopped when hitting a limit. This signal then also causes the pod to enter Memory-mode, in which case it will continue to follow the position now memorized by the WRCS.</p>
<p>Additionally, the signal will also be send if the pod is deselected, i.e. Video Select Switch - Weapon (Maverick), or WSO DSCG Mode - not TV (for example switching to Radar)</p>
<p>Laser System</p>
<p>The laser can only be operated in the Track-mode and serves two purposes: guiding laser guided weapons on a target, and accurate slant range measurement.</p>
<p>Slant range is, besides weapon impact calculations, used for the automatic target stablization in Track-mode. If not measured with the laser, it is computed based on inaccurate INS and WRCS data, resulting in a degradation of the system.</p>
<p>The laser can be used when the LASER READY lamp is illuminated.</p>
<p>To setup the laser, a valid code has to first be entered on the Laser Coder Control panel and transferred to the pod by pressing the Enter-Button. Make sure that the NO GO light is not illuminated.</p>
<p>The LASER READY push button has to be pushed in for the laser to be armed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the laser is guarded by the nose gear position, which has to be fully retracted to prevent accidental use on the ground.</p>
<p>Once ready, the laser is fired during track mode by pressing full action on the Antenna Stick. The status of the laser operation is indicated by the cues on the display being steady or flashing.</p>
<p>The T0 cue indicates intention to fire the laser, while the TTG cue represents the outcome of the laser usage. The slant range measured by the laser is compared to the slant range computed based on INS and WRCS data. If it is not within ?20% of that value, it is rejected.  This is indicated by TTG flashing slow.</p>
<p>The system can be forced to use the laser range regardless, by pressing the Reject/Override Button.</p>
<p>In practice, laser measured range is much more accurate than the slant range computed by the system. Hence, pilots developed a habit of always hitting the button whenever they fired the laser.</p>
<p>Weapon Release Modes</p>
<p>The pod offers two additional weapon release modes:</p>
<p>WRCS Auto Mode</p>
<p>ROR (Release on Range)</p>
<p>Auto Mode</p>
<p>The main method of weapon delivery with the pod is the WRCS automatic release mode.  The WRCS has to be integrated with the pod for it to be available, and the pilot must select TGT FIND as delivery mode, as well as WRCS on the range indicator.</p>
<p>This mode works the same as the Dive Toss mode of the WRCS, just that it will use the pods computed slant range and target instead.</p>
<p>The TTG cue will move down and meet the T0 cue to indicate the time to release.</p>
<p>ROR</p>
<p>Release on range is mostly a backup mode. The pilot must select TGT FIND as delivery mode, and ROR on the range indicator.</p>
<p>Weapons will be released automatically, as soon as the computed slant range is less than the set desired release range. The range is configured on the range indicator, by setting the mode to SET and rotating the knob below the display.  Best results are achieved during level flight.</p>
<p>Stow</p>
<p>After turning on the system, the pod can be unstowed by pressing the STOW push button.</p>
<p>When unstowed, the pod moves according to the current selections and automatically goes into the WIDE FOV.</p>
<p>In the stowed position, the camera is rotated upwards and a cover is moved in front of it. This protects the camera from stones and other hazards during taxi, takeoff or low level flight. The stow-procedure takes about 5 seconds, with the light indicating the current status.</p>
<p>Note that the stow-position is held electrically and can not be held without power.  Unpowered, the pod swings freely with force. Taking off without first applying power to the pod, or flying with the pod being powered off, will cause the pod to leave the stow position. Outside of the stow position, the system will get damaged through hazards and whenever it is forcefully moved into its gimbal limits. Damage will not only offset the boresight position, but also affect other properties, such as movement speed and similar.</p>
<p>Cooling</p>
<p>The targeting pod has a cooling system installed in the rear section, which automatically cools the pod by external airflow.</p>
<p>In general, the system is capable of keeping the pods temperature within limits during all normal operation. However, if the temperature gets out of control, the Overheat lamp will illuminate. In this case, make sure to turn off the pod immediately and give it some time to cool down first. Ignoring the lamp will cause parts of the pod to melt, damaging it irreparably.</p>
<p>A broken pod is generally indicated by the MALF lamp going on and the display being all black. To prolong use of the pod and prevent overheating, limit slow and low-level flight, as well as continuous use of the laser. As a rule-of-thumb, do not use the laser for longer than 15 minutes without allowing for cooling between uses. Limit continued slow and low level flight while operating the pod to 30 minutes. For extreme outside temperatures, adjust the limits accordingly.</p>
<p>BITs</p>
<p>The pod has 5 built-in tests, with BIT 1 being the actual mode used during normal operation. They can be activated and switched through by clicking the BIT button below the display. The GO/MALF lights show the result of the BIT:</p>
<p>GO - test was successful</p>
<p>MALF - test detected a failure</p>
<p>During normal operation, activated through BIT 1, neither of the lights are illuminated.</p>
<p>BIT 0</p>
<p>All lights on the Target Designator Set Control illuminate with full brightness. The pod does not need to be powered up for this test. GO/MALF do not indicate test results in this mode.</p>
<p>BIT 1</p>
<p>The circuits are energized and monitored. If any voltage reading is abnormal, MALF illuminates. GO does not illuminate in this mode.</p>
<p>This is the standard operational mode. The pod can be used normally and the system will continuously monitor the status.</p>
<p>BIT 2</p>
<p>The system simulates track functionality, simulating all inputs, altitude and range data. After about 15 seconds, the test is finished with either GO or MALF illuminating.</p>
<p>For the test to be successful, the aircraft must not be moving, the pod must be unstowed and INS must be integrated.</p>
<p>Bit 3</p>
<p>This tests the laser energy level. The pod moves to a special position where it looks inside itself, such that the laser fires against a special sensor mounted inside the pod.</p>
<p>The pod must be unstowed and a valid laser code must have been entered, as well as the LASER READY button being pushed in. The nosegear guard is ignored during the test, allowing the use of the laser on ground.</p>
<p>Once the pod has reached the test position, the WSO must press and hold the Reject/Override button to start firing the laser. The laser stops firing when the button is released.</p>
<p>When the laser fires, a 5 second test program starts, with the sensor measuring the laser energy. After the 5 second test, either GO or MALF illuminate to indicate whether the energy level was above the required minimum.</p>
<p>To pilot can assist in telling the WSO that the test position has been reached, as indicated by the Azimuth-Elevation Indicator.</p>
<p>Bit 4</p>
<p>The system tests the ranging computation by feeding a simulated laser slant range of 2100 ft (?200).  The pilot can confirm this using the Range Indicator readout.</p>
<p>After about 8 to 14 seconds, the test is finished and either GO or MALF is lit.</p>
<p>Upgrades</p>
<p>Based on crew feedback, the Pave Spike targeting pod received two major upgrades, which are available as separate selectable weapon in DCS.</p>
<p>Smart-Track</p>
<p>TCTO 518, known as the Smart-Track upgrade, aims at removing the requirement to press the Reject/Override button to force the laser measured slant range in situations in which the computed slant range was usually too inaccurate. With the upgrade, the system will automatically accept the laser slant range whenever the pods elevation gimbal is above -7.5 degrees. I.e. in shallow angles, for example during 12-VIS mode.</p>
<p>Fast-Track</p>
<p>The popular upgrade TCTO 519 overhauls the pods gimbal motors, increasing the
movement speed from 15 dps to 60dps.</p>
<p>At this speed, the targeting pod is capable of tracking a target during low altitude high speed flight, such as overflights at 1,000 ft with 500 knots.</p>
