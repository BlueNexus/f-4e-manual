<em>(Mockup of the F-4 with AIM-7 Missiles)</em></p>
<p>The developmental onset of the F-4 Phantom II began in the aftermath of
McDonnell's loss in the US Navy's 1953 Day Fighter Competition- the victor of
which was the Vought F8U. Choosing not to rest on failure, McDonnell
representatives canvased the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics, a number of operational
commands, the office of the Chief of Naval Operations, and any pilot or
maintainer willing to discuss the state of current naval aviation. After nearly
a year of analysis and design work - including a full scale mockup, the design of
what they would classify as a general fighter took shape. The potential of a
general fighter aircraft, rather than the specialized focus preferred by the
Navy at the time, was rooted in the success of the F3H-1 Demon
in threading of that very needle;
the Demon had been built as design in opposition of the F4D Skyray in the
interceptor role. As the Skyray proved its supersonic superiority during the
development cycle, McDonnell expanded the F3H Demon's capabilities to include
respectable air to ground armament to justify its place in the limited carrier
compliment when compared to the F10F Jaguar and F7U Cutlass, which were also
undergoing development at the time. Ultimately outfitted with the AIM-9
Sidewinder and AIM-7 Sparrow - the latter giving the F3H a beyond visual range
capability the Skyray could never boast, and topping out with the ability to
carry and deliver 6,000 lbs of air to ground ordnance, the Demon out-measured
its competitors in combat potential, even when it came in second on paper for
raw performance.</p>
<p>Beginning with the intention to grow out the Demon as the baseline airframe, a
set of engineering evaluations were performed including both single and twin
engine configurations with different wings. The two most promising data sets-
twin-engine builds of the type designated the F3H-G and F3H-H- powered the
General Electric J65 and J79 respectively, replaced the original Demon wing with
a 45 degree swept wing. Particular focus was paid towards making the new
aircraft multi-mission capable, running a wide gamut of potential operations:
day or all-weather attack, photo recon, day or all-weather interception with a
Sparrow-compatible radar, electronic warfare, and a two seat strike coordination
configuration. Experimentation with this wide-ranging design intent went so far
as to include a novel interchangeable nose and cockpit arrangement, allowing
airframes to be reconfigured within a matter of hours for a given mission set
with the necessary systems fit for the crew.</p>
<p>While the Navy showed little interest in the nose replacement capability, the
bottom line numbers from the F3H-G and -H investigations got their attention: on
paper, they were capable of Mach 1.52, and an eye-watering Mach 1.97 at 35,000',
respectively. By October of 1954, Navy Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) had
evaluated similar unsolicited proposals from Grumman, Douglas, and North
American, and provided McDonnell with a $38 million dollar contract for two
flying examples of the Demon follow on- internally designated as the AH-1.</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/F3HG.jpg" alt="McDonnell F3H-G Mockup" />
<em>(McDonnell F3H-G mockup; US Navy photo)</em></p>
<p>Two months later, the Navy threw McDonnell a curveball, directing the type to
be stripped of the air to ground fitment, and focusing on the all-weather
interceptor role in a single seat configuration, with the finalization for this
change in role being formally announced in April of 1955. The changeover was, in
some quarters, considered catastrophic- over time forcing the removal of the
planned internal gun, and stripping all of the hard-points, save for the
recessed Sparrow fuselage wells and a centerline tank position. At this point,
the determination of the J79 as the power plant was finalized with the Navy's
desire for a Mach 2 interceptor. Further, the determination of a two-man crew as
also put in place by the Navy - like McDonnell's own research, success in the
faster, longer ranged interception environment showed the utility of a second
man to handle the scope.</p>
<p>However, it wasn't a done deal. BuAero had been keeping conversation with Vought
at the same time, and in mid-1955 detailed a fly-off between the two competing
firms for the new interceptor role; this time pitting McDonnell's AH-1 contender
with an outgrowth of the already in-service Crusader: the F8U-3. Redesignated
the F4H in the intervening two and a half years leading into the late 1958
fly-off, McDonnell's Phantom II would trade substantial blows with Vought's
Crusader III during the Navy Preliminary Evaluation. Whereas McDonnell's design
entered the flight testing phase a month prior (and nominally entered
engineering almost a year ahead of Vought's entry), the benefits of Vought
carrying over much of the prior Crusader's aerodynamic profile appeared early in
the comparison, as the Crusader III was first to Mach 2 in flight testing, shown
capable of reaching higher top speeds during the Navy preliminary evaluation (NPE),
and noted for having more refined airframe handling in most regimes.</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/f-4h_aboard_uss_independence.jpg" alt="f-4h_aboard_the_uss_independence" />
<em>(F-4H aboard the USS Independence in 1960; US Navy photo)</em></p>
<p>But as the Evaluation continued, it was found that McDonnell's Phantom II
countered the Crusader III where it mattered: in combat capability. The Navy
wanted a Mach 2 interceptor, not an overgrown daylight fighter. The F8U-3's
integration of the Sparrow was found lacking versus that of the Phantom, having
surrendered an AIM-7 against the F4H due to aerodynamic performance concerns. Of
even greater concern for the interceptor role- as McDonnell had previously found
internally, the pilot overhead to manage the AN/APG-74 radar installation in the
Crusader III while in combat was found to be too high to maintain effectiveness,
whereas the back-seater in the Phantom II could reliably acquire situational
awareness on the radar and maintain track locks for engagement while
maneuvering. McDonnell's F4H, while having more raw flying qualities, could
fight as the Navy needed it to. Further, as the firm had continued developing
its air to ground potential at the request of the Navy, even as they repeatedly
altered the program goals- the Phantom II, like the Demon before it, justified
its existence in the carrier compliment in all fights, not just the long range
interception role. And so on December 17th, 1958, the Navy Preliminary
Evaluation board announced its findings and the winner of the fly-off:
McDonnell's Phantom II.</p>
<p>The US Air Force was not oblivious to the Phantom II's development, as the Navy
having asked for the air to ground capability be revisited gave McDonnell a
point of entry. While the Air Force entertained McDonnell representatives in
discussion about a new ground attack airframe, the service actually had interest
in the Sparrow-dealing F4H as a replacement for the F-106. The Air Defense
Command requested an evaluation in 1961 known as Project High Speed, which once
again proved the Phantom II superior to a challenger in the interceptor role. In
light of the findings, Navy offered a bombing demonstration for Air Force
representatives of the Tactical Air Command, making special note of the
successful air to ground trials with the Phantom's multiple ejector racks- a
capability the USAF lacked. With Air Force policymakers, members of Congress,
and even Gen. Curtis LeMay in attendance during this demonstration series- with
a VX-5 F4H-1 accurately delivering twenty-two 500 lb bombs in spectacular
fashion, the stage was set for a Navy/McDonnell tactical aviation coup.</p>
<p>The inauguration of the Kennedy administration in January 1961 didn't hurt
matters; Kennedy brought in former Ford Motor Company president Robert McNamara
as Secretary of Defense. With an eye for optimization- sometimes to a fault, the
performance of McDonnell's F4H was seen as a standout to capitalize upon in
light of the administration's new conventional doctrine of &quot;Flexible Response&quot;;
no longer would nuclear deterrence be the primary backstop of the US' promise to
NATO. While McNamara desired for the Navy's A-7 and the Air Force's F-111 to
fulfill tactical bombing roles for both services, the two airframes were at
least five years out to operational capability; the Phantom existed, provided
outstanding performance immediately, and could quickly raise the desired 50%
increase in conventional force structure the White House expected for the Air
Force. Pressure from all sides - the White House, Congress, McDonnell, and
foreign interest, ultimately defeated the USAF's resistance to an airframe &quot;not
made here&quot;, and by January 1962 the USAF's budget had Phantoms on order the
Tactical Air Command; the Air Defense Command, which had started the Air Force's
investigation into the Phantom, would be left with the F-106.</p>
<p>Designated for a time as the F-110 to fit in with the Air Force's Century Series
as a matter of service pride, McDonnell's Air Force Phantom went into motion. An
initial delivery of Navy-configured F4Hs were provided for training and
evaluation later that year, with the first flight of a true F-4C taking place on
May 27th, 1963- the universal service designation system converting the F4H-1 to
the F-4B in September of 1962. Reconfiguration of the Phantom II for the USAF
was expedient, with the focus being on service-compliant alterations; these
included altering of the landing gear system for higher speed field operations,
the addition of dual flight controls, an anti-skid implementation, and
conversion to boom refueling compatibility. Further changes included the
addition of the LN-12 inertial navigation system, conversion to the APQ-100
radar with air to ground specific functionality, and a cartridge starting system
for field use without a compressed air cart in combination with an internal
battery. This F-4C configuration would be the first Phantom used during the
USAF's involvement in Vietnam, beginning in December of 1964.</p>

<p><img src="intro/../img/F-4B_VF-111_dropping_bombs_on_Vietnam.jpg" alt="F-4_dropping_over_Vietnam" />
<em>(F-4B dropping bombs over Vietnam; US Navy Photo)</em></p>
<p>The Phantom's initial deployments to Southeast Asia delivered a number of
firsts - the first officially confirmed MiG-17 kill with the AIM-9 Sidewinder (on
July 10th, 1965), and the first US air-to-air shootdown of a MiG-21 (April 26th,
1966). Unfortunately, the Phantom was also the victim of the first US loss to a
SAM in Vietnam (July 24th, 1965), and the first US air-to-air loss from a MiG-21
(October 5th, 1966). With the initial teething problems of the type out of the
way - including alterations to the wing fuel cells and internal wiring, the
Phantom was found to be a capable, reliable airframe for the Air Force. Even the
missing gun had been worked around to some degree, with the integration of the
SUU-16 and SUU-23 external cannon pods. The in-production upgrade to the Air
Force's first Phantom - the F-4D, would include a multitude of quality of life
improvements: the APQ-109 radar with air to ground modes, the ASN-63 internal
navigation system, the ASQ-92 release computer. Further additions would include
automatic fuel transfer and a new sight, the ASG-22. Combat survivability would
be reinforced with the APS-107 RHAW and ECM pod compatibility, along with new
ejection seats. Yet, the service's desire to put its own &quot;made here&quot; flourish on
the type continued, inauspiciously culminating in the integration of the AIM-4
Falcon with the F-4D model.</p>
<p>Used on the F-102 Delta Dagger and F-106 Delta Dart, and considered by some to
be a reasonable competitor to the AIM-9 Sidewinder, Air Force leadership
believed the AIM-4 could be installed in replacement of the Navy's short range
round with no loss of capability; this was quickly found to be a mistaken
premise. While the AIM-9B had limited maneuvering restrictions for launch and
acquisition like other short range infrared missiles of its generation, it was
substantially more reliable in use; the Falcon's cooling implementation could
only maintain the required seeker temperature for a short time once activated,
and could not be turned back on once the cooler timed out, while the un-cooled
9B could remain available indefinitely. Sidewinder acquired far more rapidly - in
many instances in less than two seconds, versus the six to seven seconds
required for the Falcon. Worse still, the AIM-4 was a hittile- its fin-contact
triggered fuzing required direct target impact for the missile's warhead to
detonate, whereas the AIM-9 carried a proximity fuze; any Sidewinder that got
close to its target was a threat to kill.</p>
<p><img src="intro/../img/F-4Ds_435th_TFS_over_Vietnam.jpg" alt="f4_over_vietnam" />
<em>(F4-D of the 435th TFS over Vietnam)</em></p>
<p>With initial F-4D deliveries to the 8th TFW in May of 1967, the performance of
the new configuration was quickly met with derision. The employment envelope was
too small compared to the Sidewinder, the lead time too long, and the weapon far
too unreliable to put into practice in the dynamic maneuvering environment of
air combat as it was waged in Southeast Asia. The failure of the Falcon to
succeed not only served to reaffirm the quality of the Sidewinder in comparison-
and also highlight the need for the service to upgrade the round as the Navy was
doing, but reinforced the concern held by aircrews about the lack of an internal
gun. SUU installations by this point had scored multiple victories over North
Vietnamese MiGs (ultimately ending the war with 9 confirmed kills), and it was
decided to rectify what many had considered the Phantom's original sin with
further revision to the F-4.</p>
<p>By the point McDonnell laid down the program update plan for the F-4E, the jet
was intended to carry with it the APQ-120 CORDS (Coherent On Receive Doppler
System) radar. With the directive to install an M61 internally, the radar would
receive changes to its mount, additional dampening, and alteration to its
antenna to fit in the reduced profile fuselage cavity directly above the cannon
barrel assembly. Hardware deleted for Sidewinder compatibility in the F-4D was
updated and returned. The ASG-26A Lead Computing Optical Sighting System was
installed along with updated aircrew in-range and shoot warning cues, solving
yet another lingering issue with the original F-4 specification; much has been
said and written regarding the lack of the gun in the Phantom and the lack of
training with respect to its performance over Vietnam - in the same respect, the
lack of effective cueing for the pilot and WSO as to their orientation and range
to target degraded many a shot opportunity. The updates to the Echo Phantom
would not stop there; compatibility with multi-ejection racks and updates to the
Weapon Release Computer to match provided further bombing capabilities. Further
changes over its service included provision for &quot;soft wing&quot; leading edge slats,
the AGM-65 Maverick, and the Digital Scan Converter Group interface for the
APQ-120.</p>
<p>Also of note was Rivet Haste - a late Vietnam training initiative heavily
influenced by two midlife updates- modification &quot;556&quot; and TISEO. Prior to
&quot;556&quot;, weapons mode changes required the pilot to go hands off the throttle and
look down to the release panel, cycling a number of switches to disarm various
pylons and arm others; in the event of a lucky North Vietnamese bounce, or the
need to swap between weapons on the fly - looking away from the threat was time-consuming
and dangerous. With the modification, a pair of override switches were
added to the outboard throttle grip. The first, the &quot;pinky&quot; switch, placed
control of the gun, Sidewinder, and Sparrow in one of three positions, while the
second, on the forward face of the grip, switched weapons modes immediately
between air-to-air and air to ground; the pilot would now have immediate access
to his air-to-air weapons, and could swap them on the fly - never once looking
down in the cockpit. 556 also included modifications to the armament panel for
air to ground munitions, adding ripple release capability while reducing the
number of controls required to access full ARBCS programming. Further
reinforcement of crew initiative was the installation of TISEO - the Target
Identification System Electro-Optical. Consisting of a 4x/10x camera installed
in the left wing, TISEO provided visual identification of distant, radar-locked
targets, enabling the AIM-7 Sparrow to be used to its full extent. Coupled with
the Rivet Haste training - which put experienced aircrews through a program to
codify them as systems and tactics instructors (not unlike the NFWS education
being given to USN crews at the same time), the students championed the
modification program of the Phantom, and pushed for Double Attack (a parallel
development of Loose Deuce as had been used by the Navy in Vietnam since the
resumption of the bombing campaign) to become the standard for air-to-air
methodology across the Air Force. While this training was ultimately too late to
have real effect, with the final halt on US bombing coming just weeks after the
first Haste student crews returned to Vietnam, they would set the tone for USAF
Phantom crews going forward.</p>

<p>The F-4E that is implemented in the game is another upgrade from the F-4D for the US Air Force and
several other countries. It featured an integrated M61 Vulcan gun elongated in the Nose as well as
an AN/APQ-120 Radar with a reduced size to fit in with the new internally mounted M61 Vulcan. Other
upgrades included the J79-GE-17 engines with 17,900 lbf of afterburner thrust for each engine,
leading-edge flaps and slats to improve the maneuverability especially at high angle of attack. The
F-4E Phantom II was the most numerous version that has been built totalling at 1370 units. The F-4E
Phantom II is still in service at some operators across NATO including the Hellenic Air Force, the
South Korean Air Force and the Turkish Air Force. They are expected to fly at least until 2030.</p>

<p><img src="intro/../img/real_life_greek_phantom_lands_riat.jpg" alt="real_life_f_4e_greece_lands_in_riat" />
<em>(Hellenic Air Force F-4E Phantom II lands at RIAT 2008, UK)</em></p>
<p>The F-4E Phantom II, a stalwart in the annals of military aviation, transcended its American origins
to become a formidable force in the service of numerous foreign air forces. Its foreign deployment
was a testament to its adaptability, longevity, and indomitable presence on the global stage.</p>
<p>In the NATO, the F-4E found itself in the arsenals of key member nations. Germany, Greece,
Turkey, and the United Kingdom incorporated the Phantom into their fleets, contributing to the
collective defense capabilities of the alliance. The F-4E's reputation for versatility and
reliability made it a linchpin in NATO's strategic posture during the tense years of the Cold War.</p>
<p>Venturing into the turbulent skies of the Middle East, the F-4E became a symbol of air superiority
and technological prowess. Israel, Iran, and Saudi Arabia were among the regional players that
embraced the Phantom. In the crucible of Middle Eastern conflicts, the F-4E showcased its ability to
navigate diverse operational landscapes, earning its place as a linchpin in the complex geopolitics
of the region.</p>
<p>Across the vast expanse of the Asia-Pacific, the Phantom's distinctive silhouette graced the skies
as it found a home in the air forces of Japan, South Korea, and Australia. Whether patrolling the
Pacific or standing ready for regional contingencies, the F-4E played a vital role in ensuring the
security of nations in the region, underscoring its adaptability to varying strategic environments.</p>
<p>Israel's relationship with the F-4E was particularly noteworthy. The Israeli Air Force, recognizing
the Phantom's potential, not only deployed the aircraft in conflicts but also embarked on ambitious
modification programs. These enhancements, ranging from avionics upgrades to the integration of
modern weapons systems, transformed the F-4E into a customized instrument of air power tailored to
Israel's unique security needs, nicknamed Kurnas or Sledgehammer.</p>
<p>Amidst the ever-evolving landscape of military technology, foreign operators of the F-4E undertook
comprehensive upgrades and modernization efforts. These initiatives were aimed at extending the
aircraft's service life and enhancing its combat capabilities. The F-4E, with its iconic twin tails
and powerful engines, evolved to meet the demands of contemporary warfare, solidifying its place as
a venerable platform in the arsenals of its adoptive nations.</p>
<p>The F-4E Phantom II's foreign service was not merely a chapter in the history of military aviation
but a saga that unfolded across continents and through the corridors of geopolitical power. Its
adaptability, longevity, and combat prowess etched the Phantom into the collective memory of the
nations that flew it, leaving an enduring legacy in the skies it once dominated.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="f-4e-air-to-air-kills"><a class="header" href="#f-4e-air-to-air-kills">F-4E Air to Air Kills</a></h1>
<p>The F-4E Phantom II, an upgraded version of the F-4 Phantom series, played a significant role in
air-to-air combat during the Vietnam War. Equipped with the AIM-7 Sparrow missile, a radar-guided
weapon with beyond-visual-range capabilities, the F-4E had a notable advantage in engagements.</p>
<p>In Vietnam, F-4E pilots engaged in dogfights against various enemy aircraft. The Sparrow missile
allowed them to target adversaries from a distance, contributing to the aircraft's success. Key USAF
pilots, such as Steve Ritchie and Chuck DeBellevue, achieved ace status by securing five or more
air-to-air victories.</p>
<p>The total number of air-to-air kills attributed to the F-4E Phantom II, combining both the USAF and
USN, is estimated to be around 21 during the Vietnam War, includeing 4 MIG-19s, 17 MiG-21s. However,
this figure may vary across sources. In total F-4C/D/E Variants shot down 107 MiG Jets hence the
name &quot;Biggest distributor of MiG parts&quot;.</p>
<p>Despite its effectiveness, the F-4E faced challenges in close-quarters combat due to the initial
absence of an internal cannon. Modifications, including the addition of an M61 Vulcan cannon,
addressed this limitation and improved the aircraft's performance in close-range engagements.</p>
<p>The success of the F-4E Phantom II in Vietnam solidified its reputation as a versatile and
formidable fighter, and it continued to serve in air forces worldwide for many years.</p>

<p><img src="cockpit/pilot/../../img/AWRU.jpg" alt="AWRU" /></p>
<p>Provides timed interval release scheduling of single or multiple bombs or
rockets and dispensed munitions based on the selections made between the
interval knob, the QTY (quantity) knob and the INTRVL switch.</p>
<p>For further information
see <a href="cockpit/pilot/../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">Aircraft Weapons release unit (AWRU).</a></p>
<h3 id="interval-knob"><a class="header" href="#interval-knob">Interval Knob</a></h3>
<p>The interval knob provides release pulse sequences between 0.05 second and 1
second.</p>
<h3 id="interval-switch"><a class="header" href="#interval-switch">Interval Switch</a></h3>
<p>The INTRVL switch provides the option of a 10x multiplier of the set value of
the interval knob. In the NORM position, the interval knob value is the trigger
timer.</p>
<h3 id="quantity-knob"><a class="header" href="#quantity-knob">Quantity Knob</a></h3>
<p>Controls how many stores are released per impulse.</p>
<p>Selecting &quot;1&quot; places the AWRU into single manual bombing mode; one push of the
bomb release button releases one bomb.</p>
<p>Selecting a value from &quot;2&quot; to &quot;18&quot; sets the AWRU into single ripple mode; in
this mode, the AWRU will release bombs according to the programmed interval
until the set number of rounds is dropped, or the bomb button is released. Upon
release, the count is reset, and a subsequent press and hold will drop the
programmed number of bombs.</p>
<p>Selecting &quot;C&quot; sets the AWRU into single continuous mode; pressing the bomb
release button drops rounds according to the programmed interval until the bomb
button is released, or all munitions from the selected pylons are expended.</p>
<p>The &quot;P&quot; setting is for pairs manual mode. With at least two stations selected,
each push of the bomb button will release two bombs; like single manual mode,
this does not include an interval function.</p>
<p>Lastly, the &quot;S&quot; setting, for salvo, releases bombs in accordance to the chosen
interval from all selected stations simultaneously, until the bomb button is
released. Ergo, if four stations are selected with a 2 second interval (0.2 on
the interval dial, X10 INTRVL switch setting), four bombs will be released every
two seconds the bomb button is held down.</p>

<h2 id="fire-test-button"><a class="header" href="#fire-test-button">Fire Test Button</a></h2>
<p><img src="cockpit/pilot/../../img/pilot_fire_test_button.jpg" alt="FTB" /></p>
<p>When pressed, this button tests for functionality of the FIRE and OVRHT lamps.
Under normal conditions, all four lights should light up as long as the button
is pressed down. If a lamp does not light up, it is likely broken and cannot be
trusted on indicating a fire condition anymore.</p>
<p>The button can also be used in conjunction with the Warning Lights Test switch
to confirm detection and continuity performance of the fire and overheat warning
systems.</p>
<p>Holding the Warning Lights Test switch in the WARN TEST position, then
simultaneously pressing and releasing the Fire Test Button performs the test.
Proper system function is confirmed with the four FIRE and OVRHT lamps off while
the Fire Test Button is pressed, then illuminating when it is released.</p>

<p>The throttle arrangement for each engine in the F-4E Phantom II is located on the front and rear
cockpit left console. Mechanical linkage transmits throttle movement to the engine fuel control. A
friction adjusting lever allows customization of throttle friction. Afterburner initiation occurs by
shifting the throttles outboard and moving forward from the MIL position. The Afterburner gate can
be adjusted in the special options of the module.</p>
<p>Throttle movement is smooth and continuous, with afterburner modulation possible throughout the
range. Moving throttles from IDLE to OFF closes the fuel shutoff valve, stopping fuel flow. To
transition from OFF to IDLE or MIL, advance the throttles straight forward. Shifting throttles
outboard allows movement from MIL to MAX, enabling forward motion in the afterburner range. For

<p>The anti-G system delivers low-pressure auxiliary air to the anti-G suits, with air passing through
the anti-G suit control valve before reaching the suit. The suit remains deflated up to
approximately 1.5 G, and as G forces reach or exceed this level, air flows into the suit
proportionally. The suit stays inflated in relation to constant G forces and begins to deflate as G
forces decrease.</p>
<p>A manual inflation button in the anti-G suit control valve enables the crewman to manually inflate
the suit for system checks or fatigue relief. A pressure relief valve within the system activates at
approximately 11 psi, serving as a safety backup in case of malfunction. The system operates
automatically whenever an engine is running, ensuring continuous support for the wearer during
varying G-force conditions.</p>

intended target and triggers half-action on the Antenna Hand Control stick. The range strobe is
positioned relative to in-range on a closing target, and the WSO selects
full-action. To solidify the track, the WSO uses the Manual Vc knob to place the

Track cursors to their default positions, and resets the velocity tracking system values to zero.</p>
<h3 id="along-track-wheel"><a class="header" href="#along-track-wheel">Along Track Wheel</a></h3>
<p>Used to define relative range of the aircraft to the Radar initial Point, using an
expanding/contracting hemisphere cursor on the radar display. This hemisphere
presents true range to the target via the hemispherical PPI projection, thus
allowing the Radar initial Point to be detected in an offset approach to the target. Close
approximation of range to the Radar initial Point should be prepared first with the Along Track
wheel prior to using the Cross Track Wheel for best system accuracy- ie, the
cursor should be placed below the intended Radar initial Point return on the radar scope, and
the Cross Track wheel brought to the return point.</p>

<p>The Primary flight instruments include every instrument needed for basic flight of the F-4E.
Included are the True Airspeed Indicator (TAS), the ground speed indicator, Accelerometers,
combined Airspeed and Mach Indicators, radar and barometric Altimeters, a backup magnetic compass,
vertical velocity indicators, different turn and slip indicators as well as cockpit attitude
indicators.</p>
<h2 id="true-airspeed-indicators"><a class="header" href="#true-airspeed-indicators">True Airspeed Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/TASInd.jpg" alt="TASInd" /></p>
<p>True Airspeed Indicators are provided in both cockpits, and carry a calibrated
range from 150 to 1500 knots. While the indicators can read as low as 0 knots,
the lack of calibration below the stated range means values less than 150 knots
are inaccurate. At high rates of airspeed change, there may be a lag of up to
+-10 knots in measurement.</p>
<p>The rear True Airspeed Indicator is removed for DMAS equipment in aircraft so
configured; however, TAS is provided as a DMAS function.</p>
<h2 id="ground-speed-indicator-1"><a class="header" href="#ground-speed-indicator-1">Ground Speed Indicator</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/wso_ground_speed_indicator.jpg" alt="wso_ground_speed_indicator" /></p>
<p>A ground speed indicator is provided in the rear cockpit, with a range from 0 to
1999 knots. Ground speed is provided by the navigation computer, with the source
dependent on INS function. If the INS online, the ground speed value calculated
is based on the provided velocity, and can display correct information as low as
0 knots. When the INS is offline, the air data computer performs a calculation
using crew-entered wind information, which can cause errors of up to 150
displaying while the aircraft is on the ground with the parking brake set.</p>
<p>With DMAS installed, the rear ground speed indicator is removed, as GS is a DMAS
function.</p>
<h2 id="accelerometers"><a class="header" href="#accelerometers">Accelerometers</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/GGauge.jpg" alt="GGauge" /></p>
<p>Both cockpits retain accelerometers for monitoring G load; the accelerometers
carry 3 needles - one for current G loading, and a positive and negative G
loading needle for the highest load G-load detected since the accelerometer was
reset. To reset the gauge, the PUSH TO SET button will return the recording
pointers to positive 1 G.</p>

<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/MachInd.jpg" alt="MachInd" /></p>
<p>Found in both cockpits is a combination Airspeed/Mach indicator. The indicators
provide a fixed airspeed scale at the middle of the indicator, reading values
from 80 to 850 knots, and a rotating Mach number scale to the outside,
with readings from 0.4 to 2.5 Mach. A two position push-and-rotate knob offers both an airspeed
index with a functional range between 80 and 195 knots, and a Mach index pointer
with a range between 225 knots and 850 knots.</p>
<h2 id="altimeter-2"><a class="header" href="#altimeter-2">Altimeter</a></h2>

<p>Altimeters in both cockpits provide a functional range from 0 to 80,000 feet. To
the outside of the indicator is a pointer scale, gradation in 50 foot units with
markings every 100 feet (from 1 to 10). Left of center is the counter,
increasing and decreasing in value in thousand foot increments on the black pair
of rollers, hundred foot increments on the white. Barometric scale adjustment
can be performed using a dial. A three position switch provides the RESET
function for the altimeter to draw signals from the air data computer for normal
operation, and the STBY (standby) option to only use the pneumatic pressure to
determine altitude. Standby mode is noted with a red flag in the indicator. In
the event of an altimeter or air data computer failure in normal operation, the
STBY flag will appear, and cannot be reset. This can also be followed by
warnings on the telelight panel.</p>

in bank angle, or 0 to 35 degrees angle in pitch. The dial scale reads from 0 to
100 feet, and the system includes a red low altitude warning light that
illuminates when the aircraft is detected below a pilot-set altitude.</p>
<p>Activation and setting of the radar altimeter warning height is done with the
same knob; turning the knob clockwise initially activates the indicator,
removing the displayed OFF flag; continuing to rotate the knob moves the
reference marker that will determine the altitude which triggers the low
altitude warning. A self-test, initiated by pressing the function control
switch, shows 35 +-15 feet. Above 5000 feet or with unreliable signals, the
pointer hides behind a mask, showing the OFF flag. The OFF appears also when
power is lost; the indicator will then present the last altitude detected above
ground level at the time of this occurring.</p>

<p>In the front cockpit, a turn and slip indicator is added to the ADI on the
instrument panel; while the needle provides correct direction of turn, it does
not provide proper turn rate information.</p>
<p>A conventional 4-minute turn and slip
indicator is found on the rear cockpit panel.</p>
<p>To execute a controlled turn (360° in 4 minutes), place the vertical needle
over one of the indicators on either side (turn rate of 1.5 degrees per second) and ensure
the slip indicator at the bottom is centered to prevent over- or under-turning due to
incorrect bank.</p>

<p>The Pitot-Static system provides impact and static pressure to flight
instrumentation, the Air Data Computer, and airspeed-driven switches. To
alleviate icing of the pitot head, a Pitot Heat Switch is found in the front
cockpit right console.</p>
<p>The Pitot Heat switch should always be turned on before takeoff but not for
longer than one minute as it could damage the instrument.</p>
<h2 id="air-data-computer-system"><a class="header" href="#air-data-computer-system">Air Data Computer System</a></h2>
<p>Using a variety of static, attitude, and environmental inputs, the Air Data
Computer (ADC) provides the pneumatic and electrical inputs to the AFCS, Fire
Control System, Air Induction System, the INS, the LCOSS, navigational computer,
and manages the variable bypass bell mouth system for the engines. Flight
through weather such as ice or rain can induce errors in the performance of
these systems until the condition has cleared, and this should be taken into

<p>The Static Pressure Compensator (SPC) performs correction of altimeter lag
caused by rapid altitude change. The SPC must be reset after engine startup on
each flight; this is performed using the CADC switch near the throttles by
selecting RESET CORR, then selecting NORM. Should an issue occur during flight
causing a STATIC CORR OFF warning, an attempt to reset the SPC can be performed
with RESET CORR. Should the STATIC CORR OFF warning fail to clear, care must be
taken in all diving maneuvers, as substantial altimeter lag will occur.</p>

<h2 id="control-sticks"><a class="header" href="#control-sticks">Control Sticks</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_control_stick.jpg" alt="FlightStick" /></p>
<p>A control stick is provided in both cockpits, with near-uniform switchology
between the two. A Trim Control is found on both sticks to provide force
reduction and minor flight path correction in the pitch and roll axis. Weapons
are deliverable through both a Trigger
(for <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../stores/air_to_air/overview.html">air-to-air missiles</a> and the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../stores/guns.html">gun</a>)
and a Bomb Release Switch. Both sticks carry
a <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/gear_ground_handling.html#nose-gear-steering">Nose Wheel Steering button</a> that
doubles as a <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../radar.html">radar</a> auto-acquisition control for the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../radar.html">radar</a> in visual
range combat, and sensor focus control for
video-directed <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../stores/air_to_ground/overview.html">air to ground weapons</a>. An
<a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/gear_ground_handling.html#emergency-anti-skid-quick-release-lever">Emergency Quick Release lever</a> on
each stick is available to immediately deactivate the anti-skid, ARI, autopilot, and stability
augmentation. Unique to the front cockpit control stick is
the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../utility.html#air-refueling-release-button">Air Refueling Release Button</a> - a dual-role
control that performs the boom disconnect function its name implies, as well as
a number of weapon selection functions.</p>
<p>Also, unique to the front cockpit stick is a force transducer, to allow the pilot
fine adjustment control of the AFCS with the autopilot functionality engaged. In the event the force
applied to the stick exceeds the AFCS breakout limit, autopilot will be turned off.</p>
<h2 id="aileron-spoiler-control-and-stabilator-control-feel-and-trim-systems"><a class="header" href="#aileron-spoiler-control-and-stabilator-control-feel-and-trim-systems">Aileron-Spoiler Control and Stabilator Control Feel and Trim Systems</a></h2>
<p>The Aileron-Spoiler Control System and the Stabilator Control System both offer
trim following; the former through a screw jack actuator, the latter using a
servo directed by the AFCS.
These functions cause the stick to position relative
to the current trim and autopilot position when the crew member in control goes
&quot;hands off&quot;. It is therefore advisable to maneuver the stick to the same
position, or to gently move the stick to &quot;breakout force&quot; prior to disengaging
the autopilot system to reduce the chance for an abrupt return to pilot control.</p>
<p>To confirm current state of the stabilator trim, a Stabilator Trim Position
Indicator is provided on

<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/ext_flight_controls_rudder.jpg" alt="ext_rudder" /></p>
<p>Yaw axis control is directed by the rudder pedals found in both cockpits. To
offset any relative skidding due to wind effect, stores imbalance, or minor
<a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../engines_and_fuel_systems/engines.html">engine</a> output deviation,
a <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/front_section.html#rudder-trim-switch">Rudder Trim Switch</a> is
found on
the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/front_section.html#inboard-engine-control-panel">engine control panel</a>
in the front cockpit. On the ground, the pedals themselves can be pressed
independently for differential braking, and the rudder axis itself functions as
the nose wheel steering directional control when
the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/gear_ground_handling.html#nose-gear-steering">Nose Wheel Steering button</a>
on either control stick is pressed.</p>

<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/ARIfuse.jpg" alt="ARIfuse" /></p>
<p>To assist in low speed turn coordination, the Phantom II includes an
Aileron-Rudder Interconnect. The system is engaged automatically with the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/wall.html#slatsflaps-control-panel">Slats
Flap Switch</a> in the Out and Down
position, and below the flap blowup speed of 230
knots. With the system engaged, the rudder can be driven up to 10 degrees by the
interconnect to alleviate pilot workload. The circuit breaker for the ARI is located right of the
Emergency stores release.</p>
<h3 id="emergency-ari-disconnect"><a class="header" href="#emergency-ari-disconnect">Emergency ARI disconnect</a></h3>
<p>In the event either seat in command requires the ARI deactivated, the system can be disconnected by
pulling
the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/gear_ground_handling.html#emergency-anti-skid-quick-release-lever">Emergency Quick Release lever</a>
on their respective control stick. Releasing the switch will re-engage the ARI. Function of the ARI
can always be overridden through the rudder pedals.</p>
<h2 id="stability-augmentation-system"><a class="header" href="#stability-augmentation-system">Stability Augmentation System</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_stability_augmentation_switches.jpg" alt="pilot_stability_switches" /></p>
<p>The F-4 offers a three axis Stability Augmentation system, with independent
Pitch, Roll, and Yaw channels. The system is to smooth out flight in normal
cruise regimes, rather than provide enhancement in maneuvering. The control
panel for the Stab Aug system is found in the front cockpit.</p>
<p>The Pitch channel provides a maximum control authority to the stability
augmentation of one half degree (0.5) above or below the current pitch trim
setting.</p>
<p>The Roll channel gives the stability augmentation 7.5 degrees of control of the
ailerons, and up to 11 degrees of deflection to the spoilers.</p>
<p>The Yaw channel permits augmentation up to 5 degrees left or right from the
current rudder trim position.</p>
<p>Because the stability augmentation system can misinterpret roll oscillation in
high AoA maneuvering and inadvertently invoke adverse roll, it is suggested to
disable the Roll channel prior to aerobatics or combat to alleviate this
possibility.</p>
<p>With the Roll stability augmentation system engaged, roll rate using the rear
control stick can be less than that in the front cockpit relative to the amount
of deflection; conversely, when returning control to the front cockpit, the rate
can jump due to said difference.</p>
<h2 id="auotmatic-flight-control-system-afcs"><a class="header" href="#auotmatic-flight-control-system-afcs">Auotmatic Flight Control System (AFCS)</a></h2>
<p>The automatic flight control system (AFCS) is an electro-hydraulic system designed to provide
stable, accurate and coordinated flight maneuvers without interferring with manual control. The
System utilizes the displacement gyro (for pitch and roll) additionally to the heading reference
signals to maintain the airplane in the desired attitude with maximum stability.</p>
<p>In the F-4E DSCG variant there are two modes of operation, AFCS and Altitude Hold. In the AFCS mode
of operation maintains any aircraft heading and/or attitude selected within the limits (± 70° pitch,
70° bank and 360° azimuth), providing the G-Limits (+ 4G or - 1G) are not being exceeded. During
AFCS mode, two accelerometers are utilized to ensure proper functioning of the AFCS system. One of
the accelerometers is a G-Limiting type to prevent excess G-loads from occuring as a result of AFCS
operation, the other accelerometer is a lateral accelerometer which is used to perform coordinated
maneuvers while in AFCS or stability augmentation mode.</p>
<h2 id="slats-flap-system"><a class="header" href="#slats-flap-system">Slats Flap System</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/ext_slats_and_flaps.jpg" alt="ext_slats_and_flaps" /></p>
<p>The Slats Flap system is manually selected for takeoff and landing, then
automatically controlled relative to AoA for best handling performance in all
other flight regimes. Control is through
a <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/wall.html#slatsflaps-control-panel">three position switch</a> found
outboard of the left <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/front_section.html#throttles">throttle</a>

The <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/wall.html#slatsflaps-control-panel">three switch positions</a> are
Norm, Out, and Out and Down,
and the resulting command can be moderated based on whether or not the landing gear being deployed.</p>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/SlatsRelative.jpg" alt="SlatsRelative" /></p>
<p>Norm is the standard in-flight position, locking the Flaps and automatically
programming the Slat deployment as a function of AoA.</p>
<p>Out deploys the Slats to their fully deployed position. Should the landing gear
be deployed, both the Slats and Flaps will deploy.</p>
<p>Out and Down fully deploys both the Slats and the Flaps. Should the landing gear
not be down, the Wheels Light on
the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/right_sub_panel.html#telelight-annunciator-panel">telelight</a> Panel will
illuminate and flash.</p>
<p>Both cockpits have
a <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_sub_panel.html#slatsflaps-indicators">Slats Flap Indicator</a>, which read In
and Out, along with a
barber-pole reading when the surfaces are in transition.</p>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/SltFlpInd.jpg" alt="SltFlpInd" /></p>
<p>In the Norm position, Maneuvering Slat deployment is a function of AoA; above
11.5 units they will extend, then retract when the aircraft is reduced below
10.5 units. Maneuvering Slat operation includes a speed-induced blowback; slats
will retract due to air pressure between 568 and 602 knots.</p>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/SlatsOvrd.jpg" alt="Slats Override" /></p>
<p>To the rear of the Fuel Control Panel in the front cockpit is the Slat Override Switch. Guarded,
this switch has two positions: NORM and IN. Defaulted to NORM under the guard, switching to IN
forces the retraction of the slats, no matter the current aircraft AoA or state of the Slats Flap
Switch position; this action will trigger the SLATS IN warning on
the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/right_sub_panel.html#telelight-annunciator-panel">telelight</a> Panel and
illuminate the <a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/right_main_panel.html#master-caution-light">Master Caution</a>.</p>
<p>The Slats Flaps system also has an Emergency system; handles are found on the
<a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/pilot/left_console/wall.html#slatsflaps-control-panel">Slats Flaps control panel</a> in
the front cockpit, and next to the rear cockpit
<a href="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../cockpit/wso/left_console/front_section.html#throttles">throttle</a> pair. The emergency system
uses pneumatic pressure, and does not
require electrical power to force deployment. The emergency system can only
function once, and can be actuated at any airspeed; however, above 230 knots,
the Flaps will retract based on air pressure, and the normal Slat retraction
speeds also apply.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>💡 Extension of the landing gear and thus the nose
gear door changes the airflow around the probe causing to indicate higher
angles by 1 unit. The approach airspeeds account for that. Therefore, performing
an approach with the gear retracted, will cause the indicators to show
approximately 1 unit low, and the aircraft will be roughly 5 knots fast for an

<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/manual_aural_tone_in_flight.jpg" alt="manual_aural_tone_in_flight" /></p>
<p>The Aural Tone System provides audible feedback in maneuvering flight and during
landing configuration. Beginning above 15 units AoA with gear down, and 21 units
AoA with the gear up and slats in, a pulse will be heard by both crew-members.</p>
<p>The rate of the pulse can vary from 1.5 to 20 pulses per second, with increasing
frequency based on higher AoA values.</p>
<p>This tone can be lowered in volume below 20.3 units AoA gear down/25 units gear
up with controls in each cockpit; exceeding these values will cause the system
to override the volume limits and deliver the warning pulses at a minimum
volume to ensure they are audible regardless of volume setting.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The respective knobs are labelled STALL WARNING and can be found on the right
side in either cockpit. They must not to be confused with the AURAL TONE CONTROL
knobs, which control weapon related tones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Due to limited forward visibility, the tones are a crucial aid during landing.
If a low pitch tone playing at a pulse is heard, the aircraft is too fast.
If a high pitch tone playing at a pulse is heard, the aircraft is too slow.
For the proper on-speed configuration, a steady tone at a medium pitch is played.</p>
<h2 id="stall-warning-vibrator"><a class="header" href="#stall-warning-vibrator">Stall Warning Vibrator</a></h2>
<p>The left front cockpit pedal includes a Stall Warning Vibrator, which is
activated over 22.3 units Angle of Attack. This physical (and in DCS audible)
indication is given to make the pilot aware of the potential of an impending
stall and provide enough time to reduce AoA and prevent the loss of control of
the aircraft. Reducing AoA below the threshold will deactivate the warning.</p>

<p>The F-4 Phantom uses a conventional tricycle landing gear arrangement, driven by
the Utility hydraulic system. The Landing gear is electronically controlled and hydraulically
actuated by the utility hydraulic system. Accidential retraction of the landing gear when the
aircraft is on the ground is prevented by safety switches on the main gear. The gear is locked down
by internal finger latches which require hydraulic pressure to release. The automatic disable of the
nose gear steering and anti-skid system is realized by scissor switches located in the landing gear
bays. In the event Utility hydraulics are offline, an emergency extension system using compressed
air is available to lower the gear for landing.</p>

<p>Emergency landing gear extension is driven by a pair of compressed air bottles
carrying sufficient charge for lowering the gear one time. The emergency extension
is commanded in the front cockpit is performed using the Gear Control Handle;
pulling the handle aft in any position releases the compressed air into the
landing gear hydraulic system, forcing the gear doors to open and the gear to
lower and lock. Extension can also be performed in an emergency from the back
seat using a handle on the left sub-panel marked EMERG LDG GEAR. Pulling this
handle performs the same action as pulling the front cockpit gear control handle
aft.</p>

<p>Nose Gear Steering is actuated using the referenced button on the control stick
in either cockpit. Holding the button down permits the crew member to steer the
aircraft using the rudder. Steering limit of the nose gear is 70 degrees from
centerline in both directions.</p>
<p>Rudder steering becomes effective at approximately 70 knots. At this
speed Nose Gear Steering should be disengaged and not be used any further.</p>
<h2 id="wheel-brakes"><a class="header" href="#wheel-brakes">Wheel Brakes</a></h2>
<p>Differential steering is provided with weight on wheels using rudder pedal
deflection. Assistance in braking performance is provided by an included
Anti-Skid System, which engages with the aircraft over 30 knots. Braking
function is delayed by the Anti-Skid System on landing until the right main gear
has been in contact with the ground for 3 seconds, or the wheels reach 50 knots
of rotation.</p>
<h2 id="anti-skid-system"><a class="header" href="#anti-skid-system">Anti-Skid System</a></h2>
<p>The electronically controlled anti-skid system
provides anti-skid protection at wheel speeds over 30 knots. The system detects the start of a skid
and releases the brake pressure in proportion to skid severity. Below 30 knots the anti-skid
protection is not available and braking is in direct proportion to the brake pedal movement. The
system has a built-in touchdown protection feature that prevents braking until 3 seconds after
weight is sensed on the right main gear or wheel spin up to 50 knots. It should be noted that a low
coefficient of friction between the runway and tires (as it occurs during Aquaplaning or on icy
runways) may lead to the wheels not spinning up or cause them to slow below 30 knots wheel speed
after spin-up. In this case the system falsely detects the aircraft speed below 30 knots and reverts
to manual braking.</p>

<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_emergency_hydraulic_brake.jpg" alt="EmergencyHydraulicBrakeSystem" /></p>
<p>In the event of a Utility hydraulic system failure, emergency differential
braking is provided by pulling the Emergency Brake Handle on the lower left side
of the instrument panel in either cockpit. Doing so forces hydraulic pressure
from a reserve accumulator, and provides enough power for approximately 10 brake

<h2 id="arresting-hook-system"><a class="header" href="#arresting-hook-system">Arresting Hook System</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_tail_hook.jpg" alt="ArrestingHook" /></p>
<p>The Phantom carries a retractable arresting hook for ground stopping in
emergency takeoff and landing situations that will reach the strip overrun.
Placing the Arresting Hook Handle in the front cockpit into the DOWN position
will lower the hook in approximately five seconds. Lowering the hook will
illuminate a red warning lamp in the Hook Handle, and illuminate the HOOK DOWN
warning on the telelight panel.</p>
<p>The system is not intended to be used for carrier operations.</p>

<p><img src="systems/flight_controls_gear/../../img/pilot_drag_chute_handle.jpg" alt="DragChuteHandle" /></p>
<p>The F-4E has an available Drag Chute to reduce landing roll as necessary. The
chute can also be used for spin recovery. Deployment of the chute is performed
by rotating the handle found in the front cockpit. The chute is drawn from its
door with a smaller pilot chute. Once the chute has deployed and performed
sufficient braking action or the aircraft has recovered into a controllable
state, the chute is jettisoned by pressing the button and pulling the handle
back, then lowering it. This action releases the chute cables and allows it to
pull free.</p>
<p>Do not use the Chute in excess of 200 Knots IAS while landing.</p>
<p>For spin recovery the Chute can be used by pushing the stick full forward, putting ailerons and
rudder in a neutral position and deploying the chute.</p>

<p>The F-4E Phantom II is equipped with two <a href="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/./engines.html">General Electric J79-GE-17A/F engines.</a> A
turbine-type starter, powered by external air or the expanding gases of a solid
<a href="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/./engines.html#cartridge-mode-starting">propellant cartridge,</a> is employed for engine cranking during
starting.</p>
<p>The F-4E Phantom II features an internal fuel system comprising interconnected cells in the fuselage
and two internal wing tanks. External fuel can be carried in two wing-mounted 315-gallon tanks and a
600-gallon fuselage-mounted tank.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="engines"><a class="header" href="#engines">Engines</a></h1>
<p>The F-4E Phantom is powered by two J79-GE-17 engines built by General Electric,
with a rated static sea-level power delivery of 11,870 pounds of thrust in Mil,
and 17,900 pounds in afterburner. The engines have provision for both assisted
pneumatic start at fields with an available cart, or via a propellant cartridge
to initiate spin-up. Similarly, the engines can utilize the aircraft's internal
battery for initial power, or connection with an external power cart.</p>
<h2 id="fuel-flow-indicators"><a class="header" href="#fuel-flow-indicators">Fuel Flow Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/FFI.jpg" alt="FFI" /></p>
<p>Each engine has a fuel flow indicator found in the front cockpit instrument.</p>
<p>The indicators read in thousands
of pounds per hour, from 0 to 12. The indicators provide flow rate up to Mil power; when afterburner
is engaged, a separate fuel delivery system is used to provide fuel directly to the
afterburner stage, and the flow rate is approximately 4 times the value shown.</p>
<p>Fuel Flow should not
exceed 1200 pph at lightoff and 800 to 1500 pph at idle operations. Fuel consumption for Engine
start is approximately 65 pounds per Engine.</p>
<h2 id="oil-pressure-indicators"><a class="header" href="#oil-pressure-indicators">Oil Pressure Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/OilPress.jpg" alt="OilPress" /></p>
<p>Oil pressure indicators are on the front
cockpit pedestal panel, and are graduated from 0 to 10, and are presented in 10 lb increments.
Normal values are 15 psi while
the engines are running.</p>
<h2 id="variable-duct-ramp"><a class="header" href="#variable-duct-ramp">Variable Duct Ramp</a></h2>
<p>Optimization of air to the engines is performed by a Variable Duct Ramp system
directed by the Automatic Duct Control (ADC); this optimization uses a pair of variable ramps to
decelerate incoming air to subsonic for best engine performance. In the event
limits are exceeded for inlet temperature, the Duct Temperature High Indicator
Light (DUCT TEMP HI) on the telelight panel will illuminate. Permitting the issue to continue can
cause permanent engine damage.</p>

<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/ext_ground_cart.jpg" alt="ext_cart" /></p>
<p>The normal mode for starting the Phantom utilizes an auxiliary start cart that
turns the starter turbine, cranking the engine over.</p>
<h3 id="cartridge-mode-starting"><a class="header" href="#cartridge-mode-starting">Cartridge Mode Starting</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/f_4_cartridge_start.jpg" alt="f_4_cartridge_start" /></p>
<p>Cartridge mode is supplied for operational and emergency needs. A propellant
charge is used to turn the starter turbine, which in turn cranks the engine over
to initiate startup.</p>
<h3 id="start-switch"><a class="header" href="#start-switch">Start Switch</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_start_switch.jpg" alt="StartSwitch" /></p>

the respective engine.</p>
<h3 id="ignition-system"><a class="header" href="#ignition-system">Ignition System</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_ignition_system.jpg" alt="IgnitionButtons" /></p>
<p>Engine ignition for startup is performed using a pair of spark plugs on each
engine, activated by pressing the red Ignition Button found on the rear of both
throttle levers. The button is depressed as part of the starting sequence to ignite the spark plugs,
initiating combustion in chambers four and five of the engines.</p>
<h3 id="engine-anti-icing-system"><a class="header" href="#engine-anti-icing-system">Engine Anti-Icing System</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_engine_de_ice.jpg" alt="EngineDeIcing" /></p>
<p>Using
the Anti-Icing Switch
set to DE-ICE, bleed air from stage 17 is distributed to ports installed in the compressor face area
of the engines. This system does not perform de-icing functions, but is to be activated prior to ice
formation. As high Mach speeds provide enough friction heat to the air stream to deny icing in the
compressor stage, usage of the Anti-Icing System is unnecessary and can cause engine damage.</p>
<p>The system should be turned on in turbulent air and thunderstorms, or when a rise in Exhaust Gas
temperature is noted by the pilot as this is an indication for an engine icing condition.</p>
<h3 id="anti-ice-indicator-lights"><a class="header" href="#anti-ice-indicator-lights">Anti-Ice Indicator Lights</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_anti_ice_indicators.jpg" alt="pilot_anti_ice_indicator_lights" /></p>
<p>Activation of the Anti-Icing system will illuminate two lights on the telelight panel, L ANTI-ICE On
and R ANTI-ICE On. A failure of the anti-icing system with the Anti-Icing Switch set to NORMAL will
also light these telelight indicators as a warning. If the aircraft is above Mach 1.2 when this
occurs, immediate speed reduction is necessary to prevent engine loss. Because of the warning
function for the ANTI-ICE ON lamps, a condition that illuminates them will
provide a MASTER CAUTION warning.</p>

<h3 id="exhaust-nozzle-position-indicators-1"><a class="header" href="#exhaust-nozzle-position-indicators-1">Exhaust Nozzle Position Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/NPI.jpg" alt="NPI" /></p>
<p>Directed by the Exhaust Nozzle Control Unit, the paired primary (the convergent,
inner nozzle) and secondary (the divergent, outer nozzle) are actuated
independently on a schedule to maximize outlet performance versus exhaust gas
temperature. When idle, the engine nozzle will be roughly 7/8ths open, reducing
in size as the throttle approaches MIL. During operation in the MIL and AB
regions, the Control Unit moderates the nozzle size relative to throttle
position and received EGT to maintain temperatures within design limit.</p>
<p>To monitor the current position of the nozzles relative to each other, as well
as EGTs, an indicator
is provided with calibrations from CLOSE to OPEN in four increments. The nozzle indicators enable
the pilot to make a comparison of nozzle position between engines and are also used to establish a
relationship between nozzle position and exhaust gas temperature, as well as nozzle position and
throttle settings.</p>
<p>Normal settings would be OPEN with the engines off until IDLE, 3/4 to 1/2 with
engines in IDLE and 1/4 for MIL power. MAX power will not change the indicator.</p>
<h3 id="engine-master-switches-1"><a class="header" href="#engine-master-switches-1">Engine Master Switches</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_engine_master_switches.jpg" alt="EngineMasterSwitches" /></p>
<p>A pair of two-position Engine Master Switches are found on the front cockpit left console on
the inboard engine control panel. Selecting ON powers the fuel boost and transfer pumps for the
respective engine; this will occur whether the aircraft is connected to external auxiliary power or
not, as doing so without will connect the aircraft battery to the pump circuits.</p>
<p>As the Engine Master Switches arm the fuel shutoff valves, to properly shut down the engines without
external power it is necessary to return the throttles to the cutoff position prior to turning
the Engine Master Switches off, otherwise the valves will remain open.</p>
<h3 id="throttles-2"><a class="header" href="#throttles-2">Throttles</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_throttles.jpg" alt="Throttles" /></p>
<p>Paired throttles are provided in both cockpits for engine thrust control. In normal use, movement of
the throttles from IDLE to OFF will perform fuel cutoff; to prevent inadvertent engine shutdown, a
pair of finger lifts are provided to lock out the OFF position without performing this actuation.
Afterburner is attained by shifting the throttles outboard (left) at the MIL stop, then pushing them
forward.</p>
<p>The rear cockpit throttles are connected to the front throttles in such a fashion that only the
pilot can start the engines or enter the afterburner range; the WSO can reduce throttles out
of the afterburner region back into MIL operation and lower. While the rear throttles can be shifted
from OFF without pilot assistance, return to OFF for shutdown requires pilot engagement of the
finger lifts.</p>
<p>In the event of opposing commands on the throttle arms between seats, the rear
throttles will be disconnected from the front throttles to prevent damage to
the linkage. This condition may cause a reduction in afterburner authority from the front throttle
pair. Resetting the throttle linkage is performed by placing the front throttles at the IDLE or MIL
stop and moving the rear throttles in the opposite direction to which the disconnect occurred.</p>
<p>The rear throttles only hold a microphone button and speed brake switch.</p>
<h3 id="tachometers-2"><a class="header" href="#tachometers-2">Tachometers</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/Tach.jpg" alt="Tach" /></p>
<p>Both engines are provided with tachometers on the right side of the front
cockpit instrument panel, and the right side of the rear cockpit instrument panel.
The tachometers will function without external power.</p>
<h3 id="exhaust-gas-temperature-indicators"><a class="header" href="#exhaust-gas-temperature-indicators">Exhaust Gas Temperature Indicators</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/EGT.jpg" alt="EGT" /></p>
<p>Exhaust Gas Temperature Indicators are found on the front cockpit instrument panel.
The indicators have two pointers each: a large pointer for the 0 to 12 scale referencing 100 degrees
centigrade, and a smaller pointer on a separate scale with 0 to 10 referencing 10 degrees
centigrade. Measuring for these values is performed upon exit of the turbine.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="fuel-system"><a class="header" href="#fuel-system">Fuel System</a></h1>
<p>The Phantom's fuel system is duplicated; that is, their pump and feed
arrangement is the same for both the left and right engines, and they share the
same set of fuel cells. Internal fuselage fuel between all 7 cells and the wing
tanks is just over 12,000 lbs of JP-4. With two external 315 gallon wing tanks,
that value increases to over 16,800 lbs. Adding the centerline 600 gallon tank
will bring the aircraft total fuel state to just under 20,800 lbs of fuel.</p>
<h2 id="transfer-sequence"><a class="header" href="#transfer-sequence">Transfer Sequence</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/f4_fuel_system.jpg" alt="f4_fuel_system" /></p>
<p>The F-4 carries two internal wing tanks, along with seven fuel cells down the
length of the fuselage, with cell 1 resting just behind the aft cockpit, and the
remaining cells numbered in order to the rear of the aircraft. Cell 1 is the
feed cell for the engines; cells 4 and 6 each carry a hydraulic and an electric
transfer pump to supply fuel to cells 1 and 2. The remaining fuselage cells
perform a gravity feed into cells 1, 4, or 6. Cell 3 feeds cell 4 and 5, cell 2
feeds cell 1 and cell 7 feeds cell 6. With this arrangement, center of gravity
balance is maintained along the centerline. Cell 7 is the last cell to initiate
transfer in the sequence, and does not begin until the total fuel in cells 1 and
2 fall below 1800 lbs.</p>
<p>Fuel transfer from the wing and external tanks is performed by bleed air
pressurization once airborne; they will not transfer until the aircraft is off
the ground. Internal wing tank fuel is transferred into fuselage cells 1 and 3,
whereas fuel from external tanks are balanced between cells 1, 3, and 5.</p>
<h2 id="internal-wing-transfer-switch-1"><a class="header" href="#internal-wing-transfer-switch-1">Internal Wing Transfer Switch</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_internal_wing_transfer.jpg" alt="InternalWingTransfer" /></p>
<p>Should it be necessary, a two position switch is available to turn off transfer
from the wing internal tanks. Found on the Fuel Control Panel, the Internal Wing
Transfer Switch can be toggled between NORMAL and STOP TRANS.</p>
<h2 id="external-transfer-switch-1"><a class="header" href="#external-transfer-switch-1">External Transfer Switch</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_external_transfer_switch.jpg" alt="ExternalTransferSwitch" /></p>
<p>External tank transfer is controlled by the External Transfer Switch; found on
the Fuel Control Panel, the switch has three positions: CENTER, OFF, and OUTBD
(Outboard), with OUTBD referring to the wing external tanks.</p>
<p>It is not possible to transfer from the wing tanks and external tanks at the
same time. If both are selected, the external tanks will take priority.</p>
<h2 id="fuel-boost-system"><a class="header" href="#fuel-boost-system">Fuel Boost System</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/BoostInd.jpg" alt="BoostInd" /></p>
<p>Flow from Cell 1 to the engines is performed by a pair of boost pumps. The pumps
are installed at the bottom of the tank to provide fuel in the event of a
negative G excursion. The function of these pumps can be confirmed on the Fuel
Boost Pump Pressure Indicators found in the front cockpit. Engine idle pump flow
rate is 30 PSI, ±5 pounds. To confirm a ground check, a pair of Boost Pump Check
switches are found on the fuel control panel. Holding one of these switches in
the CHECK position will perform an engine shutdown, and provide feedback on the
respective Pressure Indicator.</p>

<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_fuel_level_low.jpg" alt="pilot_fuel_low" /></p>
<p>When the sensor in Cell 2 detects a fuel weight of less than 1650 ±200 lbs, the
FUEL LEVEL LOW warning will illuminate on the front
cockpit telelight panel.
This illumination is independent of the Fuel Quantity Indication System, and can
be indicative of a transfer failure.</p>
<h2 id="external-tanks-fuel-lights"><a class="header" href="#external-tanks-fuel-lights">External Tanks Fuel Lights</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_external_tanks_fuel_lights.jpg" alt="pilot_external_fuel_tanks" /></p>
<p>Any time an external fuel tank is detected to not be flowing fuel into the
fuselage, a respective light will illuminate on the telelight panel - L EXT FUEL, CTR EXT FUEL, or R
EXT FUEL. These lights will only illuminate for the respective external transfer - that is, if OUTBD
is selected, CTR EXT FUEL cannot illuminate, and vice versa. Because transfer can occur
intermittently due to flow from the tanks exceeding engine fuel consumption, the warning lamp is not
immediately indicative of an empty external tank, and should be checked against
the quantity indication system. Further, the lamps will illuminate when the air
refuel switch is set to EXTEND, with the ALL TANKS setting selected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 To confirm that the tanks are empty fly calm and level and watch if the light
stays on and the fuel gauge is not going up for at least one or two minutes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When air-to-air refueling, or when refueling on the ground and the tanks have
reached a full condition, the External Tanks Full lamps, found under the canopy
bow, will light.</p>
<h2 id="internal-wing-fuel-dump-system"><a class="header" href="#internal-wing-fuel-dump-system">Internal Wing Fuel Dump System</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/../../img/pilot_internal_wing_dump_switch.jpg" alt="InternalWingFuelDump" /></p>
<p>Fuel from the wings can be dumped directly, rather than requiring transfer into
the fuselage, using the Wing Fuel Dump Switch. This switch, when selected to
DUMP, will release fuel from the internal wing tanks at their dump lines at the
wing fold trailing edge. Flow rate is dependent on power setting and attitude,
higher engine RPM and positive pitch increases dump speed, whereas lower RPM and
a nose low condition reduces dump speed. In level flight at 85% RPM, the dump
flow rate is roughly 650 pounds per minute. Leading to the entire fuel being
dumped after roughly 15 minutes.</p>

<p>The AN/ASN-63 INS provides the F-4E aircrew and integrated weapons delivery
system with real time accurate positional, velocity, attitude, and heading
information. When the system is aligned to its most precise extent in
gyrocompass mode, the INS is accurate to 3 nautical miles per hour of circular
error probability (CEP).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 That means that after one hour of flying, the probability for an error
in precision is spread such that in 50% of cases it is either below or
above 3nm.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="inertial-measurement-platform"><a class="header" href="#inertial-measurement-platform">Inertial Measurement Platform</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/wso_ins_control_panel.jpg" alt="wso_inertial_system_panel" /></p>
<p>The system uses a four gimbal (outer roll, pitch, inner roll, azimuth) inertial
navigating platform, with the dual roll gimbals providing redundancy to
eliminate a gimbal lock in outer roll/azimuth gimbal alignment.</p>
<p>Installed on the platform are a pair of G-200 two-axis gyros, with the upper
gyro axis aligned for spin on the north-south axis while the lower gyro aligns
for east-west spin; torque detection in each gyro tracks the perpendicular axes -
ergo, the high gimbal detects east/west rotation, while the low gyro detects
north/south rotation. In this way, rotation in all three dimensions are
represented. The gyros are floated, and proper operation can only take place
once the fluid has attained operating temperature (160 degrees F); the system is
effectively climate controlled across the altitude operating range of the
Phantom. A series of precision magnetic torquers provide localization movement,
while acceleration pick-offs function within a separate electromagnetic field
perform the actual data capture from the displacements of the gyroscopes.</p>
<p>Along the platform, set orthogonally (at 90 degree respective positions) are a
trio of A-200D accelerometers. These accelerators, similarly floated to the
gyros, with a similar arrangement of torquers and displacement pickers to
provide velocity capture. Increasing the accuracy of these evaluations is the
inclusion of a tuning fork, the resonance from which eliminates effectively all
static friction in the motion capture assembly.</p>
<h2 id="navigational-computer-and-output-signal-distribution"><a class="header" href="#navigational-computer-and-output-signal-distribution">Navigational Computer and Output Signal Distribution</a></h2>
<p>The respective captured motion signals from the gyroscopes and accelerometers
are amplified in the LN-12D navigational computer, which then performs the earth
reference integration. The LN-12D compensates for all longitudes and can
effectively track as high as 80 degrees latitude, where the mechanical
limitations of calculating tangent relative to the equator is too high for the
device.</p>
<p>The AN/ASN-63 provides information to other systems in the Phantom from the
OSDU, or Output Signal Distribution Unit. The OSDU provides ground speed,
north-south and east-west velocity, total velocity, inertially stabilized
altitude, climb angle, true inertial heading, ground track, and drift angle. The
WRCS receives inertial true heading, ground track, drift correction angle, and
drift angle for its ballistics computer. Drift angle is captured for
the <a href="systems/nav_com/../../cockpit/wso/upfront_indicators.html#bearing-distance-heading-indicator-bdhi">BDHI</a>,
HSI, and FDC. Drift correction angle is also provided to the radar and LCOSS.</p>
<h2 id="alignment-options"><a class="header" href="#alignment-options">Alignment Options</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/manual_ins_alignments.jpg" alt="manual_alignment_options" /></p>
<p>The LN-12 has three modes of alignment on aircraft start: BATH, Heading Memory
(HDG MEM), and Gyrocompass alignment. Prior to performing any alignment, STBY
Reference System must be selected, the Nav Computer Control Panel should be
turned on and its position update switch should be selected to NORMAL. Local
magnetic variation should be entered on the variation counter, and the position
counter should be set to local latitude and longitude. Doing so will greatly
expedite gyrocompass alignment. Further, alignment should not be performed with
the wings in their folded position, as the magnetic flux valve that provides
compass synchronization wil be 60 degrees outside of normal position.</p>
<p>The INS also includes an in-flight position update option, should the aircrew
note gross deviation from known location fixes.</p>
<h3 id="best-available-true-heading"><a class="header" href="#best-available-true-heading">Best Available True Heading</a></h3>
<p>STBY position must be placed momentarily to avoid an INS no-go.
Once set to ALIGN, the ALIGN lamp will illuminate steadily after 75 seconds
indicating BATH Alignment is ready. Once in BATH, the INS is accurate to roughly
5 and a half nautical miles per hour CEP, although higher inaccuracies can be
seen. Once BATH is achieved, NAV mode can be selected and the aircraft flown
with the above caveat.</p>
<h3 id="heading-memory-alignment"><a class="header" href="#heading-memory-alignment">Heading Memory Alignment</a></h3>
<p>This option becomes accessible if the alignment has been previously stored and
the aircraft has remained stationary. To access it, select HDG MEM located
beneath the red guard on the control panel before transitioning the INS knob
from OFF to ALIGN. This alignment method minimizes the alignment time, offering
a relative Circular Error Probability (CEP) at the optimal end of BATH (5.5
nautical miles), or even Gyrocompass Alignment (3 nautical miles) if the
previous alignment occurred within the last 2 hours.</p>
<p>To access the accelerated HDG MEM alignment mode, the guard must be raised and
the switch actuated up, and the INS mode switch placed to ALIGN until the ALIGN
lamp starts flashing. Then, the INS can be placed into NAV mode. If time allows,
STBY mode can be selected before going to ALIGN to allow proper heating of the
gyroscopes (which goes through the illumination/off cycle as above).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Heading can be stored in the
<a href="systems/nav_com/../../dcs/mission_editor.html#ins-reference-alignment-stored">mission editor</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="gyrocompass-alignment"><a class="header" href="#gyrocompass-alignment">Gyrocompass Alignment</a></h3>
<p>Maximum system precision is found by allowing the INS to perform a full
Gyro-compassing alignment. This method permits the gyros to find the most
accurate true north reference possible, but can entail substantial amounts of
time- and even greater time based on inaccurate or missing magnetic variation
setting entry prior to powering the INS on. As an example - for a one degree
compass heading error, the time to achieve maximum accuracy on the system is
approximately five minutes, which attains an accuracy of ±10 minutes of arc
alignment, giving the aforementioned 3 nautical miles of deviation per hour. The
minimum amount of time to complete a Gyro-compassing alignment once BATH or HDG
MEM level alignment is achieved is 50 additional seconds, while a normal
alignment takes around 5 minutes. If the aircraft is aligned at 70 degrees of
latitude or more, additional time should be expected.</p>
<p>To conduct Gyrocompass Alignment, it's necessary to keep the INS in STBY mode
until the HEAT light turns off. Moving to ALIGN while the lights are still on
prevents achieving full Gyrocompass Alignment, resulting in only the BATH
process being performed. The duration of the heating phase depends on the
ambient temperature. The system heats up at a rate of approximately 20°F per
minute, reaching an operational temperature of 160°F. Once the system reaches
its operating temperature, an additional 50 seconds are required until the HEAT
light extinguishes. After transitioning to ALIGN, the light will illuminate
steadily after 75 seconds, signaling the completion of the initial BATH
alignment, initiating the gyro-compassing process. Once Gyrocompass alignment
concludes, the ALIGN indicator will flash, indicating the system has achieved
full alignment. While gyro-compassing (when the align light is steadily lit), NAV
mode can be entered at any time, though optimal accuracy will only be attained
when the ALIGN indicator flashes.</p>
<p>Any other available time prior to moving the aircraft can be spent in ALIGN to
further increase system accuracy.</p>
<h3 id="in-flight-emergency-alignment"><a class="header" href="#in-flight-emergency-alignment">In-Flight Emergency Alignment</a></h3>
<p>In the event of a significant attitude error or failure of the STBY Attitude
Reference, an emergency in-flight alignment of the INS can be executed. This is indicated by the NAV
SYS OUT LAMP illuminated. The aircraft must maintain straight and level flight, with the Reference
System Selector Knob set to STBY. Once in this configuration, the INS Mode Knob should
be switched to OFF, then to STBY for a duration of 15 seconds. Subsequently,
after the 15-second interval, return the Mode to NAV, and resume straight and
level flight. The process of resetting the Reference Selector to PRIM can be
performed approximately after 40 seconds, although the precise alignment time is
not specified.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Accuracy of the attitude in this alignment is
contingent upon how steadily the aircraft was flown during the alignment period
and subsequent alignments may be required. Following this emergency alignment,
only attitude information will be available. Velocities, position, and displays
on the navigation computer will be inaccurate and cannot be utilized for
navigation purposes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="navigation-computer"><a class="header" href="#navigation-computer">Navigation Computer</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/wso_nav_computer.jpg" alt="wso_navigation_computer" /></p>
<p>The ASN-46A Nav Computer is used for general navigation and tactical route
planning. The system contains both a great circle and rhumb line computational
capabilities, with the former being used for larger distance bearing
calculations (over 120 miles), and the latter for closer range accuracy. The Nav
Computer functions solely using aircraft-based instruments, ergo the INS, Air
Data Computer, and the magnetic compass; it can receive no information from the
<a href="systems/nav_com/vor_ils.html">ILS</a>, <a href="systems/nav_com/vor_ils.html">VOR</a>, or <a href="systems/nav_com/tacan.html">TACAN</a> systems.</p>
<p>The system can maintain relative bearing and distance from up to two specific
waypoints at a time (identified as Target 1 and Target 2, with Target 2 being
held in memory), and this information is shown on the BDHI and ADI in real time. For data to appear
on the BDHI, the Navigation Selection Switch must be positioned in NAV COMP.</p>
<p>The computer also provides confirmation of current LN-12 precision, using a pair
of lights marked LAT and LONG, as well as the Variation Sync Meter. When these
lamps are off, the current displayed position coordinates are within 1 1/2 arc
minutes precision. Magnetic variation detected by way of the INS gyroscopes is
compared against the manual performed prior to INS power-up via the Magnetic
Variation Control knob, and displayed on the Variation Sync Meter. This
deviation can be corrected on the Magnetic Variation Control Knob to bring the
sync to center. Although the magnetic variation control knob has no effect on
the meter in air data mode, positive correction prior to INS loss increases the
air data mode precision.</p>
<p>The Nav Computer can function in either Inertial or Air Data mode. Both modes
provide the same outputs but the inertial mode (default) is more accurate.</p>
<p>In the event of an INS failure, the Nav Computer reverts to Air Data mode. In
Air Data mode, the rear pilot must continually monitor and adjust true wind
direction and speed, magnetic variation, as the only dead reckoning inputs
available to the computer is true airspeed (from the air data computer) and
magnetic heading from the compass system. When the system reverts to Air Data
mode, the AIR DATA MODE lamp will illuminate.</p>
<p>During startup, the Position Control Knobs, Wind Control Knobs, and Magnetic
Variation Control Knob are used to enter known latitude, longitude, wind
direction and speed, and magnetic variation for the location of the aircraft at
that time.</p>
<h3 id="waypoint-entry"><a class="header" href="#waypoint-entry">Waypoint Entry</a></h3>
<p>Entering waypoints and target information is performed using the Function
Selector Knob and the two Target Control Knobs, one for latitude, and the other
longitude.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Name</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>OFF</td><td>System off.</td></tr>
<tr><td>STBY</td><td>System powered, but no latitude or longitude reference performed versus the values in the Target windows.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TARGET 1</td><td>Provides readouts of range and bearing on the currently entered Target window values.</td></tr>
<tr><td>TARGET 2</td><td>Selects range and bearing information from previously stored Target window values.</td></tr>
<tr><td>RESET</td><td>Deletes any previously saved Target window values, stores currently entered Target window values.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Because of the Target 2 memory function, in practice the aircrew has some
flexibility in process depending on the demands of the mission. As an example,
should the Phantom crew be tasked with a CAP or defensive role relative to a
known position (ie, bullseye), the coordinates of that location can be loaded
into the Target Control values, the Function Selector placed into RESET, and
then returned to Target 2. Any change from Target 2 to Target 1 or STBY, then
back to Target 2 will maintain said location value, easily accessed. This will memorize the entered
position into Target 2, from which it will be easily accessible by just switching the knob back to
Target 2 at any time.</p>
<p>The other common technique was &quot;leapfrogging&quot;:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On startup, the second waypoint would be stored in Target 2 memory (entry on
the Target Control values, Function to RESET, then back to Target 2).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the second waypoint location was stored, the rear pilot would then
select Target 1 for live entry of the first in-flight waypoint on the Target
Control values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During flyout to the first waypoint, upon passing it over, Target 2 would be
selected as the destination, and the next waypoint (3) would be entered on
the Target Control Values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon flyover of waypoint 2, the Function Knob would be positioned to RESET,
then back to Target 2- now pulling the waypoint 3 values from the Target
Control values.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process would be continued over the course of the flight, and allow the
rear pilot the ability to immediately switch to Target 1 for a quick check of
relative position to another location of interest if required, or an in-flight
detour (such as to a tanker track), then return back to the next stored waypoint
for navigation.</p>
<h2 id="in-flight-updating"><a class="header" href="#in-flight-updating">In Flight Updating</a></h2>
<p>In flight updating with the Nav Computer is performed using direct overflight of
known target points, using a visual or radar fix, over a <a href="systems/nav_com/tacan.html">TACAN</a> station, or via
instruction from GCI.</p>
<h3 id="inertial-mode-update"><a class="header" href="#inertial-mode-update">Inertial Mode Update</a></h3>
<p>With the Nav Computer in Inertial mode, the aircraft is flown straight and level
at a known fix location.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>On arrival, the Position Update Switch is placed in the SET position. Doing
so disengages the longitude and latitude position counters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The position longitude and latitude counters are set using their respective
knobs for the know location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Prior to arrival at the fix point, the Position Update Switch is placed and
held in the FIX position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon direct flyover of the fix point, the Position Update Switch is released,
allowing it to fall back into NORMAL.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The correction rate of the Nav Computer is roughly 3 minutes latitude or
longitude per second, and the Update Switch must be held in FIX long enough to
account for the largest value. As an example, if the deviation is 9 minutes in
latitude and 4 in longitude, the FIX position must be held at least 3 seconds
prior to the aircraft directly passing the fix location. Further, the switch
actuation from SET to FIX must be smooth and direct, as there is a half second
time delay in the computer in the pass-through of NORMAL.</p>
<h3 id="air-data-mode-update"><a class="header" href="#air-data-mode-update">Air Data Mode Update</a></h3>
<p>In Air Data Mode, the Nav Computer can be updated as in the Inertial Mode using
the SET/FIX method, or via direct rotation of the latitude and longitude
position knobs. Using the latter method requires the Function Select Knob to be
placed in STBY, TARGET 1, or TARGET 2. The SET/FIX method is preferred, as doing
so allows for instant update upon fix position flyover and release of the
switch.</p>

<h2 id="intercom-control-panel-1"><a class="header" href="#intercom-control-panel-1">Intercom Control Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/wso_intercom_control.jpg" alt="intercom_panel" /></p>
<p>Each cockpit has an Intercom Control Panel, providing a volume control knob, an
amplifier selector, and a function selector switch.</p>
<h3 id="volume-control-knob"><a class="header" href="#volume-control-knob">Volume Control Knob</a></h3>
<p>The Intercom Volume Control knob sets relative volume level for the given
cockpit; increasing volume is performed by turning the knob clockwise. The
Intercom Volume Control does not affect any other cockpit audio signal.</p>
<h3 id="function-selector-switch"><a class="header" href="#function-selector-switch">Function Selector Switch</a></h3>
<p>The function selector offers three options: COLD MIC, HOT MIC (enabling automatic
intercom operation), and RADIO OVERRIDE. While RADIO OVERRIDE operates similarly
to HOT MIC, it also attenuates all sounds except for crew communication, the pull-up
tone from the ARBCS, and the Shrike aural tone. For ground crew transmission to be
enabled, the WSOs switch must be set to HOT MIC.</p>
<h3 id="amplifier-select-knob"><a class="header" href="#amplifier-select-knob">Amplifier Select Knob</a></h3>
<p>The three position Amplifier Select Knob determines which amplification channel
is used: B/U for the backup, NORM for the normal amplifier, and EMER for a
parallel function, should both amplifiers in a cockpit fail. In EMER mode, only
audio from the other cockpit would be heard, and the volume control of all sounds
would be managed by that cockpit.</p>
<h2 id="intercom-microphone-switch"><a class="header" href="#intercom-microphone-switch">Intercom Microphone Switch</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/pilot_inter_com_mic_switch.jpg" alt="pilot_intercom_mic_switch" /></p>
<p>The microphone switch for the Intercom System is the aft position on the inboard
throttle grip in both cockpits. When using the intercom, all audio sans the
pull-up tone, stall warning and ECM are reduced (same as RADIO OVERRIDE).</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="uhf-radio"><a class="header" href="#uhf-radio">UHF Radio</a></h1>
<p>The UHF Radio provides voice and Automatic Direction Finding (ADF) capabilities
to the F-4E. The radio can receive and transmit on 3500 manually selected
frequencies, 18 preset channels, or on the standard 243.00 MHz guard channel.
The aux receiver covers an additional 20 preset channels or guard. Two blade
antennas, one upper and one lower, as well as an ADF antenna, are provided. Once
the antenna mode is set for the primary channel, the aux receives from the other
antenna.</p>

<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/pilot_uhf_panel.jpg" alt="pilot_uhf_control_panel" /></p>
<p>Two Comm Control Panels are installed, found on the right console in the front
cockpit, and on the left console in the rear cockpit. These provide management
of the radio in either seat, with selectable priority.</p>

<h2 id="speech-security-unit-ky-28"><a class="header" href="#speech-security-unit-ky-28">Speech Security Unit KY-28</a></h2>
<p>The UHF communication system is capable of providing either conventional or
crypto voice transmission and reception. Both UHF and intercom systems can be
used in combination with the KY-28 Speech Security Unit, if so desired in a
tactical or hostile environment. The KY-28 can either cipher outgoing voice
transmissions or decipher received voice transmissions, however these functions
cannot be performed simultaneously. The crew can choose between plain or cipher
mode of operation. In the cipher mode operation the KY-28 converts voice inputs
through the microphone into crypto transmissions and deciphers crypto replies
that are being received to the crews headsets. In the plain mode operation the
UHF functions as a conventional voice transceiver.</p>
<h2 id="ky-28-controls-and-indicators"><a class="header" href="#ky-28-controls-and-indicators">KY-28 Controls and Indicators</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/KY28Mode.jpg" alt="KY28Mode" /></p>
<p>The KY-28 is controlled by the KY-28 control panel and respectively the
conventional UHF or Intercom controls. Both front and rear cockpit instrument
panels display mode lights for either mode. If the mode light P is illuminated
the KY-28 and UHF/Intercom is operated in plain mode. If the mode light C is
illuminated the KY-28 and UHF/intercom is operated in the cipher mode.</p>
<h2 id="ky-28-control-panel"><a class="header" href="#ky-28-control-panel">KY-28 Control Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/nav_com/../../img/wso_ky_28.jpg" alt="wso_ky_28" /></p>
<p>The KY-28 control panel is in the rear cockpit. It has a power knob, a mode switch and a code
zeroize button. The power knob provides power to the KY-28 and can be set to either OFF, ON or RLY (
relay). The KY-28 is not powered in the OFF position. It is powered in the ON and RLY positions. If
a direct communication between KY units is desired, the ON position is to be selected.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 RLY would provide the ability to use the KY-28 as a retransmission facility,
which is not modeled in DCS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The mode switch can be set to either P (plain) or C (cipher)
operating modes. To change modes the switch has to be pulled outwards. If the
KY-28 is powered and the mode switch is set to the C position, the UHF
transmitter is automatically selected for front cockpit transmissions. Pressing
the zeroize button neutralizes the preset code in the KY-28. The zeroize button
is guarded and should only be used in emergencies or after aircraft shutdown if
required. As the code can only be set on the ground, pressing the zeroize button
during flight makes the cipher mode inoperable for the crew for the remainder of
the flight.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 To permit conventional UHF communications the mode must be set to P
(plain) even if the KY-28 power knob is in the OFF position. If the mode is set
to C (cipher), conventional UHF communication is inhibited in both the front and
rear cockpit. An exception to this is transmission and reception on guard or aux
receivers, as these are not affected by the cipher mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="ky-28-modes-of-operation"><a class="header" href="#ky-28-modes-of-operation">KY-28 Modes of Operation</a></h2>
<p>All transmitted and received signals are routed through the KY-28 unit. When the
KY-28 mode is set to P (plain), the UHF transceiver operates in the conventional
voice manner, whether the KY-28 is powered or not.</p>
<p>To operate the UHF transceiver in the KY-28s C (cipher) mode, the KY-28 has to
be powered. When operating in the cipher mode, the KY-28 unit functions in
either standby, receive, or transmit.</p>
<p>All KY-28 units remain in the STANDBY condition until either the microphone
button is actuated or a sync preamble is received. Once transmission or
reception of the crypto message has been completed the KY-28 automatically
reverts to the standby condition. While the KY-28 is in the standby condition
the radio equipment also functions as a traditional receiver as all incoming
non-crypto transmissions are passed directly to the headsets.</p>
<p>The unit switches to the cipher RECEIVE condition whenever a sync preamble is
received. The sync preamble is generated by other KY-8, KY-28 or KY-38 units
when the transmitting stations operator actuates the microphone button. The sync
preamble ensures that all units in the network are in the cipher receive
condition. The enciphered message is received immediately after the sync
preamble signal and the message is decoded by the KY-28 and passed to the
aircrew headsets in the form of plain language.</p>
<p>When the UHF microphone button is set to the UHF position, the KY-28 switches to
the TRANSMIT condition. The sync preamble signal is transmitted to all receiving
KY stations to switch to the cipher receive condition. After actuating the
microphone button, a brief tone is heard in the aircrew headsets. The tone
signal indicates that the sync preamble signal has been completed and
transmitted, after which the KY-28 is ready to transmit the crews voice input.
When the mic button is released again, the KY-28 reverts to the standby
condition. The WSO must select UHF communications with the radio selector switch
to transmit ciphered messages. The UHF transmitter is automatically selected for
front cockpit transmissions if the KY-28 is operated in mode C.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 With the C (cipher) mode selected, the transmit condition overrides the
cipher receive condition. Hence during cipher receive operation the UHF
microphone button should not be actuated until the incoming message has been
completed.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="identification-systems"><a class="header" href="#identification-systems">Identification Systems</a></h1>
<p>The identification system automatically responds to challenges from surface or airborne radar sets
and serves supplementary purposes such as providing momentary identification of position upon
request and transmitting a specially coded response to indicate an emergency. The system operates by
receiving coded interrogation signals and transmitting coded response signals to the source of the
challenge, with a proper reply indicating the target is friendly. Three modes of operation—Mode 1,
Mode 2, and Mode 3/A—are provided for security identification, personal identification, and traffic
identification, respectively. A fourth mode, Mode 4, is controlled through the IFF (Identification
Friend or Foe) control panel. Codes for Modes 1 and 3/A can be set in the cockpit, while the code
for Mode 2 must be set on the ground, ranging from code 0000 to code 7777.</p>

<p>The hydraulic power system of the F-4E consists of three closed hydraulic
systems: Power Control System 1 (PC-1), Power Control System 2 (PC-2), and the
Utility System. Each aileron, spoiler, and stabilators have two hydraulic
actuators. The PC systems are the primary hydraulic delivery to the flight control systems, with
PC-1 powering the left side of the aircraft, and PC-2
powering the right; these actuate one of the two actuators on each flight
control surface. The Utility System drives the second actuator on the flight
control surfaces, acting as both a power assist and backup. Control is retained
in the event of a failure of one PC or the Utility System. One exclusion to this
is the stabilators - rather than using the Utility System as the secondary power,
an APU unit in the tail provides the additional and backup power for the
stabilators should PC system PSI to the stabilator actuators fall below 1000.</p>

<p>In the event of a pressure loss on PC-1 or PC-2 or the Utility system below 1500 PSI, or a detected
definite pump failure, CHK HYD GAGES will illuminate on
the telelight panel along with
the Master Caution warning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 In the event of a Utility system failure on the right side, no apparent pressure loss will be
shown to underline the illumination of the CHK HYD GAGES light, whereas a left side failure will
show a loss of 200 PSI or more on the Utility system pressure indicator. In any case, if the
pressure recovers back to above 1750 PSI, the CHK HYD GAGES light will turn off. In the event of a
Utility system failure on the right side, no apparent pressure loss will display to
match the CHK HYD GAGES light, whereas a left side failure will show a loss of

<p>The F-4E derives electrical power from a pair of AC generators driven by the <a href="systems/../systems/engines_and_fuel_systems/engines.html">J79
engines</a>, a pair of AC to DC transformers, and a
battery for electrical functions

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="radar-system"><a class="header" href="#radar-system">Radar system</a></h1>
<p><img src="systems/../img/radar_dish_nose.jpg" alt="Radar Dish" /></p>
<p>A continuation of the F-4C's -100 and the 4D's 109, the Westinghouse AN/APQ-120 Fire Control Radar
is a solid state pulse radar providing the F-4E with air to air intercept functionality, air to
ground mapping, ground target reference provision to the LABS and WRCS bombing systems, as well as
radar beacon capability. The APQ-120 also functions as the display system for TISEO and TV guided
weapon imagery, and is integrated with the APX-80 interrogation system.</p>
<p>The primary conversion from the APQ-109 to APQ-120 included a reduction in the number of field
replaceable units in the nose, as well as the reduction in their size; whereas the -109 had been a
hybrid in its movement towards solid state hardware (primarily in the low voltage processing
sections), the 120 was a fully solid-state system. While this update reduced the space overhead and
weight for the system, the modification of the F-4 nose to include
the <a href="systems/../stores/guns.html#internal-cannon-m61a1-vulcan">M61 cannon</a> required a
reduction in antenna size, causing a marginal decrease in overall detection range. However, when
taken with the increase in system reliability and reduced maintenance, the tradeoff was considered
acceptable.</p>
<p>Starting with production of the F-4E block 60, and retrofitted to selected earlier block aircraft,
was the addition of the Digital Scan Converter Group display. The inclusion of DSCG increased the
overall ease of handling the APQ-120 by adding additional information on the display directly,
including current radar range setting and the calculated range rate value against the current
acquired target. Further, clarity of the display in all lighting conditions was improved by
rendering the radar reference grids directly as part of the displayed image, rather than the
previously used markings on the DVST glass. In addition, DSCG provided the ability of the two crew
members to utilize the displays independently; previously, the WSO had control over which mode both
the DVST and front seat repeater display would show. With DSCG, the pilot could utilize TISEO or TV
air to ground weapons while the WSO maintained a scan pattern or found a ground reference point and
inserted it into the WRCS.</p>
<h2 id="radar-set-control-panel-1"><a class="header" href="#radar-set-control-panel-1">Radar set Control Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/../img/wso_radar_set_control_panel.jpg" alt="wso_radar_control_panel" /></p>
<h3 id="power"><a class="header" href="#power">Power</a></h3>
<p>Initial powering of the APQ-120 starts by placing the Radar Power Knob into TEST or STBY (Standby).
The warmup cycle requires 3 minutes from selecting either setting, and confirmation of this process
is shown via the Control Monitor Meter on the Monitor Panel; after 30 seconds from cycling power,
the gauge will display a value of roughly 250vdc; from the point the needle shows power at this
nominal value, the warmup procedure will be 2.5 minutes.</p>
<p>After 3 minutes, the radar can safely be placed into OPR (Operate) for employment of the radar, BIT
testing can be performed in TEST mode, or the radar can be left in STBY for the safety of crew and
others on the ground.</p>
<p>In the event of an emergency situation requiring immediate operation of the radar, EMER can be
selected; this performs a bypass of the 2.5 minute post-power warmup cycle. A red flag will display
behind the power knob confirming usage of the EMER mode, which requires servicing to clear up.</p>
<h3 id="range"><a class="header" href="#range">Range</a></h3>
<p>Range control of the APQ-120 is mode dependent, and in some circumstances restrict range or
functionality. Both scopes - the DSCG and the pilot's repeater window, both share indications (as
well as on-screen display) of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mile ranges. Values up to 50 miles are
indicated as air intercept (AI), which provide lock-on capability against airborne targets; 100 and
200 mile ranges can be used with the Spotlight function, allowing a target at longer distances to be
manually followed with the radar until they are at a range capable of a lock. Air to ground
functionality is available in the PPI modes higher than 5 miles.</p>
<p>Selecting any range will illuminate the respective indicator lamp, as well as display the numerical
value on the DSCG display in the upper left.</p>
<h3 id="polarization-control"><a class="header" href="#polarization-control">Polarization Control</a></h3>
<p>The WSO is afforded direct control of the APQ-120's waveform polarization at the antenna feed-horn
by using the Polar Switch. The default setting is LIN (Linear); in this setting, the waveform is
transmitted in a linear alignment to the feed-horn, oriented vertically. This is also the default
setting for employment of the <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7 Sparrow</a>.</p>
<p>Also available are a pair of Circular polarization options, CIR 1 (clockwise) and CIR 2 (
counter-clockwise). Circular polarization is provided as it is less susceptible to
precipitation-related clutter, and can allow detection or tracking of a target in such weather when
a return is otherwise found to be marginal.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Only clockwise polarization (CIR 1) is compatible with the
Sparrow's receiving antenna, and thus can only be fired
in said mode. A Sparrow launched with the APQ-120 in CIR 2 will not track.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="maneuver-switch-1"><a class="header" href="#maneuver-switch-1">Maneuver Switch</a></h3>
<p>The WSO can select APQ-120 system response to acceleration that can cause a track to be dropped for
air-to-air combat using the Maneuver Switch. By default, this switch is placed in LOW G, as to
provide resistance to countermeasures and clutter that would drive the range track loop off target
under normal maneuvering. In a combat situation, selecting HI G removes such limitations and allows
the range track loop to respond to said high accelerations. If the switch is not previously selected
prior to entry, activating CAA mode automatically engages the HI G response mode. LOW G provides the
velocity reject function whilst HI G allows tracking of a maneuvering target without breaking radar
lock-on.</p>
<h3 id="scan"><a class="header" href="#scan">Scan</a></h3>
<p>The APQ-120 can search in non-boresight AI modes with a 1 bar or 2 bar scan; the number of scan bars
is set by the respective switch position. In the 2 bar scan mode, the elevation between the two bars
is separated by 3.75 degrees. Upon entry to boresight or an air to ground mode, the radar will
revert to a 1 bar scan.</p>
<h3 id="aspect"><a class="header" href="#aspect">Aspect</a></h3>
<p>Using the Aspect knob the WSO can provide an <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7</a> with a simulated
Doppler signal rather than the
actual return signal to set the desired target speed-gate for the missile. Once a Sparrow has
been tuned, the NOSE, TAIL, FWD, and AFT options may be applied to set the speed-gate with respect
to
the expected target Doppler for the intercept. Once launched the speed-gate unlocks and sweeps the
narrowly applied frequency of this simulated Doppler value. The WIDE option is available to permit
the missile to search the full doppler spectrum for the target, rather than the limited width band
set here.</p>
<p>With the application of NOSE, FWD, or TAIL on the Aspect knob, the target's aspect angle, altitude,
and target heading are displayed in the upper right corner of the DSCG scopes in lieu of the range
rate. Aspect angle is selected by positioning the Aspect knob to FWD, with right aspect values being
positive (000 through 180) and left aspect negative (000 through -180). NOSE provides target
altitude readout in thousand foot increments, but displayed in hundreds of feet (with the last digit
always 0); as an example, 36,000' would be 360. TAIL provides target heading data.</p>
<h3 id="receiver-gain-rcvr-gain"><a class="header" href="#receiver-gain-rcvr-gain">Receiver Gain (RCVR GAIN)</a></h3>
<p>The stacked RCVR GAIN potentiometers FINE on top and COARSE on the bottom, provide the ability to
adjust the receiver gain for increased return visual definition, improving clarity and discernment
of the scopes during search routines. Further, when using MAP PPI, BEACON PPI, and AIR-GRD, their
command of the STC (Sensitivity Time Control) circuit controls how the receiver's gain applies as a
matter of range, which drives image intensity in the lower part of the scope. Gain knobs do not have
an effect on the radar picture when a lock-on exists.</p>
<h3 id="track"><a class="header" href="#track">Track</a></h3>
<p>The track switch determines whether the APQ-120 will attempt a lock-on against a selected track
automatically, or through manual means. In the default center AUTO position, full-action on the
antenna hand controller initiates an automatic lock-on attempt. In the MANUAL (up) position, the WSO
initiates a manual tracking attempt upon engaging full-action, which requires the range strobe to be
placed just inside of the bracketed contact and an adjustment of the Manual Vc knob to match
closure. The third (down) position, AOJ OUT, overrides the radar's acquisition on jamming function.
If jamming should occur during an attempt that precludes acquisition, the jamming source can be used
as a lock-on target for an angle track. Switching over to AOJ OUT returns the radar to a search
configuration.</p>
<h3 id="display-modes"><a class="header" href="#display-modes">Display Modes</a></h3>
<p>The DSCG can display returns as both as a B-Sweep or as a Plan Position Indicator (PPI) display.
Proper selection of the display for the situation is required for correct fire control and WRCS
target injection functionality, and the WIDE and NAR selection dictates the relative azimuth sweep
of the radar itself- 120 degrees in full width, or a 45 degree wide slice. The display can also be
directed to provide course guidance for a Vis Ident (VI) intercept profile against a locked target.</p>
<h3 id="air-to-air-b-sweep--b-wide-b-nar-and-vi-vis-ident"><a class="header" href="#air-to-air-b-sweep--b-wide-b-nar-and-vi-vis-ident">Air to Air: B-Sweep- B WIDE, B NAR, and VI (Vis-Ident)</a></h3>
<p>The B-Sweep modes are used for air-to-air detection, tracking, and engagement. The B-Sweep
presentation shows range as a function of height on the DSCG display (higher is further), and
projects the extents of the radar sweep field out to the sides of the display; in B WIDE, the width
of the display is 120 degrees across, thus 30 degrees across per column, whereas in B NAR the
display is 45 degrees in total width, and each column is 11.25 degrees wide. In this fashion, the
whole of the display is used, with the relative cone shape of the radar sweep being distorted to a
greater degree as range closes.</p>
<p>The Antenna Hand Control is able to drive the antenna's relative position for the sweep in both
modes; in B WIDE, this is achieved by activating Half Action on the trigger, then slewing the Hand
Control left or right. In B NAR, Half Action is not required - simply moving the Hand Control left
or right will shift the antenna in relative azimuth.</p>
<p>VI (Vis-Ident) is selectable with a radar lock-on against an airborne target achieved. By selecting
this mode, the radar provides pure pursuit steering to the locked target, via an aim dot in a
similar presentation to centering for an AIM-7 shot. To fly pure pursuit on the target, the dot
should be centered in the steering error circle. When the range to target is less than 1000', the
break X anti-collision warning will appear over the display.</p>
<h3 id="air-to-ground-ppi-wide-and-ppi-nar"><a class="header" href="#air-to-ground-ppi-wide-and-ppi-nar">Air to Ground: PPI WIDE and PPI NAR</a></h3>
<p>In the Plan Position Indicator modes, the described cone of the radar sweep is not projected out to
the sides of the display; in this way, the radar presentation is less distorted relative to the
ground, although closer ranges require adjustment of the radar range setting to provide visibility
on the display.</p>
<p>In PPI WIDE, the display is a 120 degree wedge presentation.</p>
<p>PPI NAR's display is 45 degrees wide, which can be swept using the Antenna Hand Control. The display
is drift compensated, and will shift as required to maintain relative position. The PPI NAR setting
provides a range cursor for ground mapping or bombing functions. While the range cursor is shown,
there is no target lock capability. Also inhibited is receiver gain function, as well as the 5 mile
range; the lowest available range option for PPI NAR is 10 miles.</p>
<h3 id="manual-vc-man-vc"><a class="header" href="#manual-vc-man-vc">Manual Vc (MAN Vc)</a></h3>
<p>The MAN Vc switch is used when manual mode tracking attempts are made to apply a range rate value
against the track for range estimating purposes. The knob is marked 2 to 0 to 9, in a clockwise
orientation, with values of 0 heading counter-clockwise signifying an opening target (gaining range
against the fighter), whereas values from 0 to 9 heading clockwise are for closing targets. The knob
is used in manual track mode by bracketing the desired track with the acquisition cursor, selecting
half-action to show the range strobe, adjusting the position of the cursor to place the strobe just
below the target, applying a Manual Vc rate that keeps the range strobe moving at the same rate as
the target, and then selecting full-action.</p>
<p>The numbers are multiplied by 100 m/s while closure
means closing in to the F-4 and opening means the target is flying away from the F-4.</p>
<h3 id="pulse-switch-1"><a class="header" href="#pulse-switch-1">Pulse Switch</a></h3>
<p>Control of pulse width (duration) and frequency of the cycle (PRF) is managed using the Pulse
Switch. The switch provides three distinct settings, each useful under specific circumstances, and
in some instances automatically overridden by the radar mode employed.</p>
<p>Normal operation is performed in AUTO mode. Auto mode defaults to the LONG mode function, with wide
pulse width and low PRF. In the event a track is attained, power, pulse width and PRF are moderated
by the PLMS (Power Level Mode Switch) system for best lock stability; this function is only
available in AUTO mode.</p>
<p>In LONG pulse mode PRF is low and pulse width is wide, in general increasing detection range, with a
reduction in resolution and target discernment.</p>
<p>In SHORT pulse mode, a short pulse width is applied with a high, jittered PRF is applied, to
increase detection rate at close range and under maneuver.</p>
<p>In AIR-GRD mode, the pulse switch is disabled automatically and SHORT pulse is commanded.</p>
<h2 id="radar-modes-mode"><a class="header" href="#radar-modes-mode">Radar Modes (MODE)</a></h2>
<p>Radar mode selection with the APQ-120 is not necessarily discrete; each selection on the Radar Mode
Knob can involve multiple possible methods of employment of the radar. We will explain how these are
accessed in relation to the Radar Mode Knob positions, as well as the required Display Knob settings
for proper fire control interaction.</p>
<h3 id="rdr-radar-position"><a class="header" href="#rdr-radar-position">RDR (Radar) Position</a></h3>
<p>RDR Mode is used with the Display Mode selected as B WIDE or B NAR.</p>
<p><img src="systems/../img/manual_radar_modes.jpg" alt="manual_radar_modes" /></p>
<p>Used for long distance acquisition of airborne targets, RDR Mode can be used at any range, with the
capability to lock-on to a target removed in the 100 and 200 mile ranges. Detection and acquisition
of
airborne targets with the APQ-120 follow a general outline: the pilot positions the aircraft in the
general direction of the intended search, with the WSO defining the azimuth width (wide/120 degrees
or narrow/45 degrees) as required. The WSO then sets the antenna elevation to cover the desired
altitude, selecting 1 or 2 BAR scan paths to define overall scan height, and adjusts the receiver
gain controls for best resolution. Further adjustment can be performed depending on target altitude
or weather conditions by adjusting the antenna polarity, from the default LIN (Linear) transmission
to CIR 1 or 2 (Circular) for better performance in such situations.</p>
<p>Once a contact of interest is detected on the scope, the WSO brackets the target with the
acquisition symbol using the antenna hand controller, then selects and holds full action. The range
strobe will appear, and should be aligned directly over the target. If the WSO has selected the AUTO
TRACK mode, the radar will take over and perform the velocity gate tracking to complete the lock-on;
if MANUAL has been selected, the WSO will use the MAN Vc control knob to define the closure
direction and rate compared to the return, bringing the range strobe as close as possible to the
return, in-range (closer to the Fighter). Once the Vc is matched, the WSO selects half-action and
maneuvers the range strobe on the target, selects full-action (note range rate digit flashing), then
releases the trigger, maintaining the alignment of the target under the cursors with the hand
controller if full manual angle tracking is desired.</p>
<p>With a lock-on, the standard track display will appear, including the following information:</p>

<h3 id="acquisition-on-jam-aoj"><a class="header" href="#acquisition-on-jam-aoj">Acquisition on Jam (AOJ)</a></h3>
<p>Should a jamming strobe be detected, the strobe can be acquired by the antenna for angle-only
tracking. Rather than bracketing the desired contact with the acquisition symbol and pressing
full-action, the WSO isolates the jamming strobe with the acquisition symbol and presses
full-action. The radar will then maintain angle tracking of the strobe, and, in the event
burn-through of the signal is achieved, the radar will attempt a normal lock-on. Should this attempt
fail, the WSO can press half-action, make the necessary range strobe adjustment with the Antenna
Hand Control, and then press full-action.</p>
<h3 id="home-on-jam-hoj"><a class="header" href="#home-on-jam-hoj">Home on Jam (HOJ)</a></h3>
<p>Should an acquired target attempt noise jamming to break a lock-on, the radar will revert to Home on
Jam mode. In this instance, the radar will revert to range and range rate data for distance, and
maintain an angle track against the jammer strobe. Should the jammer stop transmitting or
burn-through is achieved, the radar will automatically attempt to revert to a normal lock-on. Like
the failure mode of Acquisition on Jam, should the radar not acquire the target again, the WSO
should press half-action, adjust the range strobe position on the return, and press full-action.</p>
<h3 id="spotlight"><a class="header" href="#spotlight">Spotlight</a></h3>
<p>In the 100 and 200 mile ranges, a procedure known as Spotlight can be used to maintain radar
monitoring of a target manually. Spotlighting entails placing the acquisition cursor over the
desired return, then selecting and holding the full action trigger position of the Antenna Hand
Controller. Doing so, the antenna will nutate and revert to the chosen Polar switch selection to
increase target definition, but without attempting the automatic lock-on. The target can be
maintained in a well-observable state by holding full action and following the target return with
the Antenna Hand Controller until it reaches a range that lock-on can be achieved (with the
applicable change in range setting; the radar cannot attempt a lock at an incompatible range
setting).</p>
<h3 id="bst-boresight-position"><a class="header" href="#bst-boresight-position">BST (Boresight) Position</a></h3>
<p>BST can be used with any Display Knob position.</p>
<h3 id="default"><a class="header" href="#default">Default</a></h3>
<p>Boresight mode with the APQ-120 is used by the WSO to immediately access the short range &quot;dogfight&quot;
presets of the radar. Initial selection of BST slaves the radar to 0 degrees in azimuth and -2
degrees in elevation relative to the Fuselage Reference Line (FRL). This position, with an A/A mode
selected on the gun-sight, automatically applied depression of 35 mils provides the pilot with the
boresight reference.</p>
<p>Lock-on in Boresight is not automatic; the B-Sweep presentation of the target still requires the WSO
to position the acquisition cursor and range strobe over the target and activate the full action
trigger on the Antenna Hand Controller. Once the lock is achieved, the lock-on presentation with
steering and aspect indications will be shown on the display. At this time, the pilot can maneuver
as necessary, and the radar will attempt to retain the lock out to its antenna gimbal limits.</p>
<p>In the event lock-on is not achieved, the WSO can apply an aspect instruction to the current
priority
<a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7</a> and perform a launch against the simulated Doppler applied to
the missile guidance circuit.</p>
<h3 id="cage-mode"><a class="header" href="#cage-mode">CAGE Mode</a></h3>
<p>In the event that an <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7</a>, <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_9.html">AIM-9</a>,
or <a href="systems/../stores/guns.html#internal-cannon-m61a1-vulcan">M61A1</a> must be employed against an airborne
target with the
sight in A/G mode (for example, the flight is bounced by opposing aircraft), the optical sight
reticle can immediately be slewed to the Radar Boresight Line using the Cage Button, found on the
inboard (right) throttle handle. Cage mode commands the radar into BST mode with a five-mile range,
and short pulse, and sets the firing circuit for the currently selected air-to-air weapon relative
to the Pinky Switch. For the optical sight, the command activates the respective elevation and
azimuth tracking, roll mark, and range functions of the reticle for the chosen weapon, without the
pilot having to remove a hand from throttle or stick to swap the sight mode or weapon control panel
functions.</p>
<p>Should a track condition exist prior to pressing Cage and the Pinky switch is in Radar or Heat
position, the lock is broken when the button is pressed, and the antenna slaves to boresight when
released. If the Pinky Switch is in the Gun position, the lock is not broken.</p>
<p>Cage mode can be exited from either cockpit, by placing Weapon Select knob in the pilot cockpit to
the B position momentarily, or by the WSO pressing the Air to Air button on the rear cockpit
panel. If the pilot leaves the Weapon Select knob in B, it does not preclude a later entry into Cage
mode.</p>
<h3 id="computer-automatic-acquisition-mode-caa"><a class="header" href="#computer-automatic-acquisition-mode-caa">Computer Automatic Acquisition Mode (CAA)</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/CAA.jpg" alt="manual_caa" /></p>
<p>Once in Cage mode, the radar can be selected in to Computer Automatic Acquisition using the Nose
Gear Steering button. In CAA, the radar enters a vertical-oriented scan pattern 78 degrees in height
by 15 degrees high. Actual radar lock capability within this scan pattern is from +45 degrees above
the horizon line to -9 degrees below the horizon line due to APQ software limitation. In the event
that the radar finds a suitable target within the scan volume, the target will be locked. Should the
flight crew find the locked target not be the one intended, the Nose Gear Steering button can be
pressed on either stick grip to return the radar back to the search pattern.</p>
<p>In CAA mode, the radar’s search pattern can be shifted left or right utilizing the Pinky Switch.
While this actuation will change the illuminated weapon indicated on the Head Up Display, the actual
selected weapon from the point of Cage mode entry does not change:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guns</li>
<li>Radar Focus Left</li>
<li>Heat</li>
<li>Radar Focus Center</li>
<li>Radar</li>
<li>Radar Focus Right</li>
</ul>
<p>To exit CAA, the pilot can select position B on the Weapon Select Knob, or the WSO can push the Air
to Air button. Should a radar lock be in place at the time of mode exit, it will be retained.</p>
<h2 id="map-position"><a class="header" href="#map-position">MAP Position</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/../img/manual_radar_map_modes.jpg" alt="manual_radar_map_mode" /></p>
<h3 id="map-ppi"><a class="header" href="#map-ppi">MAP PPI</a></h3>
<p>MAP PPI mode is used with the Display Mode selected as PPI WIDE or PPI NAR.</p>
<p>Used for radar bombing, MAP PPI provides ranging and azimuth information to the WRCS against a
designated target return, or a designated Radar Initial Point (RIP) offset as programmed into the
WRCS. MAP PPI targeting is limited to ranges between 10 and 50 miles in DSCG aircraft; with 5 miles
selected, the presentation reverts to a B-Scope display.</p>
<p>In MAP PPI, the application of the Along Track and Cross Track cursors and Target Injection do not
apply a target lock-on; instead, the action triggers the ground tracking interaction with the INS
and WRCS, and this is referenced on the display with the cursors moving relative to the selected
reference point, or the programmed RIP offset.</p>
<h3 id="map-b-mode"><a class="header" href="#map-b-mode">MAP B Mode</a></h3>
<p>MAP B Mode is used with the Display Mode selected as B WIDE or B NAR.</p>
<p>MAP B Mode is a search option against low-level airborne targets in ground clutter situations. The
radar is defaulted to a 1-bar scan and linear polarization, to maximize the radar's resolution. When
attempting to acquire a track through selection of the full action trigger position of the Antenna
Hand Controller, the radar reverts to the current Polar switch selection, and the antenna feed-horn
nutates to increase acquisition probability.</p>
<p>Automatic acquisition is available in MAP B in all ranges below 100 miles, and the Spotlight
procedure as explained for RDR Mode can be used.</p>
<h3 id="air-grd-air-to-ground-position"><a class="header" href="#air-grd-air-to-ground-position">AIR-GRD (Air to Ground) Position</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/manual_radar_air_to_ground_mode.jpg" alt="manual_radar_air_to_ground_mode" /></p>
<p>Air-to-Ground Mode is a specialized boresight mode available at range selections of 5 to 50 miles,
used to provide accurate range information against targets in ground clutter, whether moving or
stationary, used with WRCS dive modes. Selection of this mode aligns the radar to the Radar
Boresight line, selects short pulse width transmission, and limits lock-on range to 20 miles.</p>
<p>The pilot initiates acquisition by selecting the A/G gun-sight mode and placing the pipper over the
intended target at a dive angle between 10 and 40 degrees. At this point, the WSO will adjust
receiver gain so that only one return is visible on the scope - the Main Beam Clutter return. The
WSO then activates half-action on the Antenna Hand Control, which displays the range strobe in the
center of the acquisition cursor. Moving the acquisition cursor/range strobe combination to the
center of the Main Beam Clutter return, the WSO presses full-action for automatic lock-on to be
attempted. Once achieved, the ASE circle will appear with the range strobe centered. Range data will
be supplied to the WRCS for release of munitions at the proper distance, and the current range is
also displayed on the gun-sight pipper range bar.</p>
<p>If a false lock occurs, the lock is broken with a selection of half-action. Reattempt can be
performed with another adjustment of receiver gain to maximize the center return, then selecting
full-action. Once the ASE circle is shown, full-action can be released.</p>
<h3 id="beacon-position"><a class="header" href="#beacon-position">BEACON Position</a></h3>

<p>BEACON may be used with any Display Knob position other than VI, as desired.</p>
<p>Derived from MAP, Beacon Mode is a navigational aid presentation of airborne or ground transponders.
Selecting BEACON and the desired range, the screen presentation removes all other and returns from
the display sans the aforementioned transponders. No acquisition cursor or lock function is
available in Beacon.</p>
<p>Beacons are displayed as a set of four hash (B Display modes) or crecent (PPI Display modes)
iconograpy; the first mark of the group on the display, being the one at the shortest relative
distance to the aircraft, is the actual position of the beacon.</p>

<h3 id="meter-selector-knob-1"><a class="header" href="#meter-selector-knob-1">Meter Selector Knob</a></h3>
<p>A sixteen-position rotary knob used in conjunction with the Meter Switch to test various voltages,
currents, and signals generated by the internals of the radar, independently and in conjunction with
the Built-In-Test system. Each position is dual purpose, noted with two sets of values; when the
Meter Switch is in the VOLT position, the inner rim of the knob is active, delivering the specified
voltage of the selected position. In the SIGNALS position of the Meter Switch, the outer current or
signal value is tested.</p>
<h3 id="monitor-meter-1"><a class="header" href="#monitor-meter-1">Monitor Meter</a></h3>
<p>The Monitor Meter displays voltages, current, and signals relative to the current settings of the
Meter Selector knob in conjunction with the Meter Switch, or the current Built-In Test setting.</p>
<p>Voltages are confirmed beginning with the -250 position of the Selector knob and the Meter Switch in
VOLT, and will indicate in the &quot;1&quot; region of the gauge approximately thirty seconds after radar
power-on, signifying correct voltage delivery. After this power-up, the monitor meter will indicate
in the &quot;1&quot; region for nominal function if the voltages delivered are correct. The +35 selection is
an exception to this rule, as the value for correct function is 2.0 or greater.</p>
<p>In SIGNALS mode, the RX1-RX4 crystal current are functioning correctly with a return in the XTAL
region.</p>
<p>The EX1 and 2 test electrical frequency control crysals, and are also nominal when XTAL is returned.</p>
<p>The magnetotron, tested in MAG, long pulse operation is confirmed with a return of 1.4 to 1.8, and
short pulse operation is correct with a value of 0.9 to 1.15.</p>
<p>KLY, which tests the CW transmitter, should find a value of 0.25 to 1.25 when radiating correctly.</p>
<p>TP 1 tests the temperature and pressure interlocks, and indicates 1 when the interlocks are closed

<p>TP 2 confirms waveguide pressure, and a value of 1 is correct.</p>
<p>In LOB, the meter needle will travel roughly between 1.5 to 2.8 as a function of antenna
nutation.<br />
Lastly, the LIN and CIR selectors confirm proper linear and circular pulse performance; they only
register a value of 1 for a transmission of vertical or clockwise-rotating polarity energy. That is,
they do not return a value in CIR pulse (counter-clockwise) mode.</p>
<h2 id="apq-120-built-in-test-knob"><a class="header" href="#apq-120-built-in-test-knob">APQ-120 Built-In Test Knob</a></h2>
<p>Confirmation of proper system performance is performed using the various options on the Control
Monitor Panel; specific test modes are defined using the Test Knob, and each is described here:</p>
<h3 id="test-0"><a class="header" href="#test-0">Test 0</a></h3>
<p>Test 0 provides function testing of the DSCG display itself, as well as aim dot balance and range
rate zeroing. Selecting Test 0 with the radar power knob in test provides a basic B-sweep display,
showing the sweep strobe, horizon line, acquisition symbol, range strobe, and elevation strobe to
confirm their proper usability.</p>
<p>The B-sweep will sweep 120 or 45 degrees based on the selection of B WIDE or B NAR. In B WIDE the
sweep should be approximately 3.5 inches wide, and the scan should fill the display to within 1/8th
of an inch of the edge. The WSO should select half-action to confirm visibility of the range strobe,
which should be aligned inside the acquisition symbol. The acquisition symbol should move vertically
to the limits of the display as directed with the antenna hand control, and should similarly move in
azimuth to the limits of the B-sweep.</p>
<p>The horizon line should be 3.5 inches long with the center blanked out, and level indicating 0
degrees of roll. The pilot confirms deflection by rotating the HOR LN control on the optical sight
control panel; rotation of the knob should deflect the line at least 3/8ths an inch. Once confirmed,
the horizon line should be returned to level.</p>
<p>The elevation strobe should be present. 1 and 2 bar scan function is confirmed by selecting the
applicable mode; in 1 BAR, the sweep will resolve with no jump; in 2 BAR the elevation strobe will
jump. Elevation control response can also be checked, but should be performed in 1 BAR mode. As the
elevation thumbwheel is rotated, check that the elevation strobe moves up and down at least 55
degrees in each direction.</p>
<p>Both scopes should be adjusted for subsequent test/usage visibility using the BRT, CONTR, and PER
controls.</p>
<p>The rear scope mode knob should be positioned to RDR BIT to display the test grid. The center
azimuth line of the grid should be aligned with the upper and lower zero azimuth scribe lines on the
scopes. Adjustment is performed using the grid control knob.</p>
<p>The DOT BAL position found to the left of TEST 0 is a momentary position used to validate a full
track display. Selecting power to STBY and holding DOT BAL, the aim dot is centered in the ASE
circle and the range rate is presented numerically in the upper right corner of the scopes as +/- 20
knots. The aim dot and range rate sensitivity test is performed with TEST on the power knob and DOT
BAL held. The aim dot is located down and left of center, within the gap of the first range scribe,
and the range rate readout is 900 +/- 50 knots.</p>
<h3 id="test-1"><a class="header" href="#test-1">Test 1</a></h3>
<p>Performing combined B-sweep and PPI gain and pulse mode
functionality, <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7</a> interlock function, and
range track memory testing, Test 1 should be initiated with B WIDE selected for the Display and in
AUTO Pulse mode. Upon selecting the test, the horizon line shifts up and right to provide visibility
of the main area.</p>
<p>The B-sweep scans, and will show a number of targets. Once the receiver gain settings are correct
for the AUTO Pulse test, a minimum of 11 targets will be visible. The WSO should initiate
half-action and position the acquisition symbol past the last visible target (in respect to range).
When full-action is initiated, the range strobe sweeps in and will lock on before passing the 7th
target from the top. Lock-on is initiated when the skin track (SKIN TRK) light illuminates and the
normal track display appears, consisting of the ASE circle, aim dot, the Rmax and Rmin strobes, and
the acquisition symbol following the range gate. While locked on, the WSO should confirm that the
number of targets does not change by turning the receiver gain full counter-clockwise. The WSO then
rotates the receiver gain full clockwise, then applies half-action and repeats the check- the number
of targets will decrease. The receiver gain should then be returned to the optimum setting found
prior.</p>
<p>The test can then be rerun using SHORT Pulse mode, which presents a minimum of eight targets when
gain is correctly set (may need adjustment from the prior sequence). Initiating half-action beyond
the last visible target will then lock prior to passing the 8th target from the top. From lock-on,
the test should be followed as above to confirm lack of changing targets, then continuing.</p>
<p>During the tests, the applicable range light appears based on selection, and displays on the scope
digitally as well in the upper left of the scopes. Target and noise video should be the same for all
ranges. The acquisition symbol is also checked for stabilization in all ranges by placing it between
the 2nd and 3rd scribe lines, and then confirming it remains in that position while selecting all AI
positions on the range knob.</p>
<p>Confirmation of the PPI scan and STC (Sensitivity Time Control) is confirmed by selecting MAP for
the Radar mode and PPI WIDE or NAR as the Display mode, with any range setting other than 5. The
resulting PPI scan will sweep 120 or 45 degrees, based on the selected setting and the acquisition
symbol removed. The PPI sweep length as displayed is 3.5 inches, is shifted 5 degrees right, and
targets are visible. The WSO should adjust the receiver gain fully counterclockwise, then fully
clockwise, to confirm the transition of noise from maximum range, then extending down. Selecting TGT
FIND will display the Range and Offset cursors, which can be adjusted for visibility using the RANGE
and OFFSET CURSOR INT knobs; should they still not be visible, the Along Track and Cross Track
wheels can be used to find them. Once displayed, the WSO should place the range cursor to exit the
display at the right side of the display at the 35 degree down position, and the offset cursor with
the first angle mark to the right of zero azimuth.</p>
<p>With the pilot selecting DT as the Weapon Release mode, the offset cursor should disappear. When the
WSO selects a range of 5, the scope will revert to a B-sweep presentation.</p>
<p>Computer functions can be checked with the WSO selecting RDR for mode, the pilot placing the
gun/missile switch to Radar, and selecting CW ON. Once an <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7</a> is
tuned with a RDR status light,
the third test target should be locked. The aim dot will be stationary and centered within the upper
calibration area, and the Vc gap will be at the 3 o'clock position, which is correct for the ASE
interlock/ranging of the simulated target.</p>
<p>Range track memory is confirmed by locking the second test target with AUTO Pulse enabled, then
switching to Test 0, and monitoring the time it takes the system to unlock. Break lock will occur
within 4 to 6 seconds after the SKIN TRK lamp goes off, and the range rate circle reduces in size.
Return to Test 1, and lock the same target. Select Test 0 for one second less than the time it took
for the first unlock, and return to Test 1. The SKIN TRK light should go off in Test 0, turn on in
Test 1, and remain for at least 5 seconds.</p>
<p>This track memory test can be performed with SHORT Pulse set, and the timing should be the same.</p>
<h3 id="test-2"><a class="header" href="#test-2">Test 2</a></h3>
<p>Beginning the pure air-to-air function sequences confirming break lock
and <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7</a> head aim, selection
of Test 2 positions the radar 20 degrees right of center, and elevation 40 degrees above center.
With the WSO selecting the SHORT pulse option and the radar locked on the second target, the system
will retain lock longer than 30 seconds of the skin track (SKIN TRK) light illuminating. Against the
tenth target, the radar will break lock within 30 seconds of the skin track light.</p>
<p>The Vc gap will position at 3 o'clock if the antenna has reached the correct gimbal position and are
within 6 degree tracking capabilities of the APQ-120 are confirmed against a series of test targets.
Upon selection, the B-sweep and levation strobe return to 0 degrees in azimuth and elevation, and
provides two opportunities to confirm proper range display position (fifth target and fifteenth).
The WSO proceeds through the sequence by performing a lock on each target.</p>
<p>After locking target 4, the elevation strobe will move down 30 degrees, the ASE circle will increase
1.9 inches in diameter, and the aim dot will rotate between the ASE circle and the segmented circle
on the test grid. The dot should exceed neither by more than a quarter inch. The aim dot should
rotate inside the segmented circle when locked on target 10. Range rate information during this
series is disregarded.</p>
<p>As mentioned, range display position is confirmed on target five and fifteen. When functioning
properly:</p>
<p>the Fifth target will align with the first scribe line from the bottom of the scope, and
the Fifteenth target will align with the third scribe line from the bottom of the scope.</p>
<p>Angle track testing can also be performed for boresight mode by selecting BST.</p>
<h3 id="test-4"><a class="header" href="#test-4">Test 4</a></h3>
<p>Test 4 validates Home on Jam (HOJ) and Acquisition on Jam (AOJ) functionality of the radar,
confirming simulated Doppler injection of an <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7</a>, angle track
drift, as well as the elevation scan of CAA.</p>
<p>With a lock against a target from a prior test, upon selecting Test 4, all test targets on the
display should disappear, replaced with a locked target presentation, simulating HOJ. This will
illuminate the HOJ H indication and flash the range rate digits (which will also end in H). To
confirm re-lock from HOJ, the WSO holds half-action. The HOJ H indication will turn off, and the
display will change to the ASE circle/aim dot AOJ presentation. The range strobe can be shifted
using the antenna hand control, and the display resets back to a standard search by releasing
half-action. To confirm AOJ override, the WSO should then press full action, then positioning the
AOJ track switch to AOJ OUT; the track display should clear and return to search.</p>
<p>For simulated Doppler injection testing, the pilot should switch CW Power on and
select <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7</a> on the
guns/missile switch. The WSO should lock a test target, then observe the Vc display; the Vc gap on
the ccw edge should be found between 1 and 2 o'clock. This is the correct display area for the
simulated Doppler signal. The correct speed readout will fall between 550 +/-150 knots, and end in H
during the HOJ sequence.</p>
<p>Angle track drift is checked by locking a target in Test 3, switching into Test 4, and positioning
the B-sweep and El strobe to zero azimuth and elevation respectively. Switching the Power knob to
STBY, neither the B-sweep or elevation strobe should drift more than +/- 5 degrees before a break
lock. This should occur between 4 and 6 seconds of the switch to STBY.</p>
<p>CAA elevation is checked by switching the Display knob to VI; the El strobe will sweep between 57
and -21 degrees, while the B-sweep width will be two degrees wide.</p>
<h3 id="test-5"><a class="header" href="#test-5">Test 5</a></h3>
<p>Test 5 confirms proper function of range rate, lead angle error, CAA performance, and the Power
Level Mode Switching (PLMS) circuits. The test is initiated with B WIDE or B NAR, and the
acquisition
of a target. Range rate is indicated with the counter-clockwise edge of the Vc gap, which will
display at 12 o'clock when <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7</a> or (../stores/air_to_air/aim_9.md)
is selected. The aim dot and range rate circle display the
indications for a stationary target at 1-mile range, with a 0.56 inch diameter ASE circle,
representing a 12 foot per second radius. The range rate indicates 0 +/- 300 knots.</p>
<p>The CAA test sequence is entered with either crew-member actuating the nosewheel steering button.
Four test targets are in range, and the action switch can be used to break lock or acquire.</p>
<p>CAGE performance is validated by placing the Radar Power knob into STBY, the Radar Mode knob into
RDR, and selecting a range of 25. The Pilot activates the CAGE button, a B-sweep occurs at 0 degrees
in azimuth with the radar centered in elevation, and the air-to-air light in the rear cockpit
illuminates, along with the 5-mile indicator. The transmitter is confirmed on and in SHORT Pulse
mode with the MAG meter providing a value of 0.9 to 1.15. The WSO should press the Air to Air light,
and the radar wil return to the conditions prior to cage. The Radar Power knob should be placed in
OPR, and a lock-on performed. The Pilot selects Guns and actuates the CAGE button; under these
conditions the B-sweep and elevation do not shift to 0 degrees in each axis, and the SKIN TRK light
remains lit. The WSO can again press Air to Air, selecting 10 on the Range knob, and the pilot
deselects Guns. Actuating the CAGE button again, and the B-sweep and elevation strobes return to 0
in azimuth and elevation and the SKIN TRK light goes off. Placing the Radar Power knob to TEST, and
note the RDR MAG indication - which should be between 1.4 and 1.8, and the B-sweep and radar azimuth
should be 20 degrees.</p>
<p>Power Level Mode Switching (PLMS) function testing is performed by switching the Radar Mode to MAP,
range to 25, and LONG Pulse mode. The WSO locks the fifth target and confirms the MAG current value,
which should be between 1.4 to 1.8. The pulse setting should be then changed to AUTO, which will see
a MAG current value drop to 0.9 to 1.15, which is the operating value range for the PLMS system.
Next, the WSO should select AIR-GND mode. The MAG reading should maintain a value of 0.9 to 1.15,
which confirms automatic transition to SHORT Pulse mode, and the display switches to a 5 degree
offset B-sweep with the acquisition cursor centered horizontally on it, and the elevation strobe
at 0. The antenna hand controller should be moved fore and aft, confirming the correct transition
of the acquisition symbol along the B-sweep. The fourth target should then be locked to confirm the
ASE circle displays without a range rate circle.</p>
<p>One additional function in Test 5 is preparation for correct VI (Vis-Ident) mode performance. With
the Aspect knob in the TAIL position, selecting VI as the Display mode will switch to the VI
presentation, with fighter heading displayed in the Vc gap/range rate window. This value changes by
10 degree increments approximately every 1.5 seconds, and does not have an integrated reference, and
thus has a high probability of being incorrect by default. When the displayed heading value becomes
equal to the current fighter heading (rounded), select another mode other than VI. The heading
incrementing will stop changing, and the system will then track any further heading changes.</p>
<h3 id="test-6"><a class="header" href="#test-6">Test 6</a></h3>
<p>Test 6 checks <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7</a> display and interlock functionality. It will
begin by presenting reference of
the OFP version loaded in the Vc/Range window of the display. Launch zone parameters are pre-set
independently of the missiles loaded, and is set with Rmax between 13.5 and 16.5 miles, and Rmin
between 3.25 and 6.25 miles. The aim dot is placed within the upper calibration region, and the ASE
circle is fixed in size. The HOLD ALT light next to the pilot's radar scope illuminates.</p>
<p>To begin the sequence, the WSO should select half-action and position the range strobe past 14
miles. Having done so, the WSO then slowly pulls the range strobe back towards minimum range.</p>
<p>The HOLD ALT lamp will go off, and one of the two following indications will occur:</p>
<p>If <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7F</a> are loaded or simulated, the Vc indicator will show
3'o clock and 900 knots with Radar selected, and CW ON or STBY</p>
<p>If <a href="systems/../stores/air_to_air/aim_7.html">AIM-7E</a> are loaded or simulated, the Vc indicator will show
12'o clock and 000 knots with CW OFF.</p>
<p>With the range strobe between Rmax and Rmin, the IN RANGE light will be on and SHOOT lights will
flash. They will turn off when the range strobe passes below Rmin, and the break X indication will
display.</p>
<p>The last check confirms range and range rate indicator accuracy, and is initiated by selecting the
Display Knob to VI, selecting half-action, and positioning the range strobe at 5 miles. When VI is
selected, the aim dot will jump to the upper wright, with no Rmax or Rmin strobes present. Using
antenna hand control, the WSO will slowly range in towards zero range. Between 3 to 1.5 miles, the
display of the range meter will indicate 9000'.</p>
<h3 id="meter-switch-1"><a class="header" href="#meter-switch-1">Meter Switch</a></h3>
<p>Tied to the Meter Selector knob, the two position switch defines which value of the Meter Selector
Knob is being tested - VOLT for the inner ring voltage values, SIGNALS for the outer ring current
and signal values.</p>
<h3 id="vc-switch-1"><a class="header" href="#vc-switch-1">Vc Switch</a></h3>
<p>With selections of 900 and 2700, the switch is used to scale the Vc gap as displayed. In a DSCG
installed F-4E, the switch must remain in the 2700 position at all times for proper APQ-120 system
performance and monitoring.</p>
<h3 id="stab-switch-1"><a class="header" href="#stab-switch-1">Stab Switch</a></h3>
<p>The STAB switch controls the antenna pitch and roll stabilization modes. The default NOR (normal)
position maintains stabilization in both channels, and INS system drift compensation is further
applied. In STAB OUT the stabilization of pitch, roll, and INS drift is removed from the radar
antenna. DRIFT OUT maintains pitch and roll stabilization, while removing the INS drift
compensation.</p>
<h2 id="digital-scan-converter-group"><a class="header" href="#digital-scan-converter-group">Digital Scan Converter Group</a></h2>
<p>The Digital Scan Converter Group (DSCG) provides an integrated display system of the F-4E's radar
and electro-optical systems. The system is composed of the front and rear seat scopes, and is driven
by the Indicator Control Unit- which performs conversion of radar and video signals, along with the
application of information and fire control cueing symbology.</p>
<p>Because the ICU is a signal interpreter, and thus the DSCG panel the output of its work, the
overwhelming number of function controls on the DSCG panel are relative to controlling the display -
more aptly, what is being displayed, and its relative clarity for the WSO and pilot. In all
instances of display visibility control on the DSCG, clockwise increases the setting,
counter-clockwise reduces the setting.</p>

<h2 id="antenna-hand-controller"><a class="header" href="#antenna-hand-controller">Antenna Hand Controller</a></h2>
<p>The Antenna Hand Controller is a joystick found only in the WSO cockpit on the right console; the
joystick integrates with the radar to perform range (fore and aft) and azimuth (left and right)
positional control of the acquisition symbol on the radar display in the air-to-air modes, as well
as seeker/EO sensor direction with Maverick and Pave Spike. Additionally, the joystick includes the
Antenna Elevation Control thumbwheel, which controls the elevation angle of the antenna, displayed
via the EL strobe on the DSCG display; this elevation scan is limited in both up and down movement
to 60 degrees.</p>
<p>In the index finger position of the Antenna Hand Controller is the Action Switch; a two-position
switch designated half-action in the first detent, and full-action with full engagement. In air-to-
air modes, half-action initiates visibility of the range strobe, allowing for proper range alignment
with a target return for automatic lock-on, or selection of MAN Vc rates required for a manual lock.
With proper bracketing and range strobe adjustment, full-action attempts the automatic lock-on, or
initiates manual angle tracking of the intended target.</p>
<p>The interaction of half- and full-action for Maverick is detailed in the section on AGM employment.</p>
<h2 id="range-visident-indicator-1"><a class="header" href="#range-visident-indicator-1">Range VISIDENT Indicator</a></h2>
<p>The Range Indicator is used for close range VID intercept profiles, providing range information out
to two miles and range rate information from inside of 9000'. The information is confirmed as
radar-accurate once the range indicator jumps to 9. The gauge functions in the VI, B NAR, and B WIDE
display modes; the indicator does not function in air to ground modes.</p>
<h2 id="air-to-air-light-1"><a class="header" href="#air-to-air-light-1">Air to Air Light</a></h2>
<p>The Air to Air light is a light plus switch with the primary function of confirming entry into CAGE

<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/pilot_awru.jpg" alt="pilot_awru" /></p>
<p>Used in the BOMBS and RKTS &amp; DISP weapon modes, the AWRU provides interval and
quantity controls for munition delivery. The AWRU has both a manual and
automatic mode, and the resulting function is accessed with the appropriate
settings.</p>
<p>The Interval Knob contains 14 values, providing base interval timing of release
pulses while the bomb release button is held from 1/20th of a second (.05) to 1
second. This value can have a 10x multiplier applied to it using the INTRVL
Switch. In the NORM mode of the INTRVL switch, the release will apply as on the
Interval Knob, whereas when selected to x10, the 10x multiplier will apply - for
example, 1 second in NORM would become an interval of 10 seconds in x10 mode.</p>
<p>The Quantity Knob sets the total number of munitions dropped during a bomb
release hold, and applies the manual or automatic release functions based on the
value selected.</p>
<h2 id="single-manual-1"><a class="header" href="#single-manual-1">Single-Manual: 1</a></h2>
<p>In the 1 position, the AWRU is placed into manual mode. One munition will be
dropped on each bomb release press, with releases across multiple selected
stations dropping in a left-right-left pattern. The bomb release button must be
released, then pressed a subsequent time, to release another round.</p>
<h2 id="single-ripple-2-18"><a class="header" href="#single-ripple-2-18">Single-Ripple: 2-18</a></h2>
<p>In numerical positions 2-18, up to the total number of selected munitions will
be dropped according to the Interval setting. As an example, with a QTY of 6 and
an interval of .20, six bombs will be dropped, one every 2/10ths of a second
from the press of the bomb release button. The sequence will reset upon button
release, allowing subsequent ripples of the same quantity to be dropped.</p>
<h2 id="single-continuous-c"><a class="header" href="#single-continuous-c">Single-Continuous: C</a></h2>
<p>In position C, the quantity of weapons is dictated by how long the bomb release

each pulse, until the bomb button is released.</p>
<h2 id="pairs-manual-p"><a class="header" href="#pairs-manual-p">Pairs-Manual: P</a></h2>
<p>Position P places the AWRU into pairs mode. With multiple stations selected,

<h2 id="salvo-s"><a class="header" href="#salvo-s">Salvo: S</a></h2>
<p>In the S position, the AWRU enters into salvo mode, functioning like

panels in the cockpits, and these commands, along with INS data and radar target
ranging, are used by the ballistic computer to provide the release signal.</p>

<h2 id="target-range-controls"><a class="header" href="#target-range-controls">Target Range Controls</a></h2>
<p>The Computer Control Panel found in the rear cockpit has three TARGET entry
controls, two RELEASE entries, and a bomb DRAG COEFFICIENT entry setting, as
well as a <a href="systems/weapon_systems/../../procedures/bit_tests/wrcs.html">BIT</a> control knob for system function check. Target
entry is relative to the predetermined IP.</p>
<p>The upper range control input is for North/South, and selection of relative
bearing is noted by the N or S prefix at the start.</p>
<p>The middle range control input is for East/West, and like the previous, the E or
W prefix on the range sets the relative bearing direction.</p>
<p>The final ALT RANGE entry is for target altitude- whether the target or RIP
(Radar Identification Point) elevation as MSL, or the target/RIP's pressure
altitude.</p>
<p>Entries for North/South and East/West are in 100 foot increments, and a maximum
value of up to 99,900 feet may be entered for these distances. The ALT RANGE
entry has a maximum of 24,900 in 100 foot increments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The WRCS can be damaged if the ALT RANGE entry is greater
than the aircraft's current MSL (x100) in TGT FIND and OFFSET BOMB modes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="release-range-control-1"><a class="header" href="#release-range-control-1">Release Range Control</a></h2>
<p>The Release Range control is used to manually set bomb range in tens of feet,
and is accessible in the Laydown, Dive Laydown, and Offset Bombing modes. The
maximum setting is 9990 feet (999x10), and when used in a WRCS/AJB-7 integrated
delivery, the actual range can be as high as 99,900'.</p>
<p>The Rg control should not be set to the same value as the target range control.
Otherwise, the bomb rack delay may release late, or not at all.</p>
<h2 id="release-advance-control-1"><a class="header" href="#release-advance-control-1">Release Advance Control</a></h2>
<p>Operative in all WRCS and WRCS/LABS integrated motes, the Release Advance
Control works in conjunction with the AWRU to advance the release signal in
milliseconds. Whereas the AWRU Intervalometer setting triggers the release pulse
sequence from the moment the bomb release button is pressed, when the Release
Advance Control is applied in a WRCS driven delivery, the specific bomb location
in a multiple ripple sequence can be calculated in advance, allowing the most
effective spread possible across a given target.</p>
<p>As an example, an AWRU single-ripple quantity release of 4 is selected with an
interval of 120 milliseconds. To place the third bomb in the ripple on target,
the following equation is used:</p>
<p>\[ RA = I_R \cdot (N_{Tgt} - 1) \]</p>
<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li>\( RA \) = Release Advance Setting, milliseconds</li>
<li>\( I_R \) = AWRU Release Intervalometer setting, milliseconds</li>
<li>\( T_{Tgt} \) = Impact Sequence number of bomb desired on target</li>
</ul>
<p>\[ RA = 120 \cdot (3 - 1) \]</p>
<p>Thus, for this release, we would set the value of RA to 240 msec. This would
produce a spread of two bombs ahead of target, one on the calculated target
point, and one behind.</p>
<p>The maximum setting for the Release Advance Control is 999 milliseconds. A calculator to calculate
the Release advance in-game is provided with
the <a href="systems/weapon_systems/../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">bombing calculator</a>. You can open and close it by pressing

<h3 id="ballistic-computer"><a class="header" href="#ballistic-computer">Ballistic Computer</a></h3>
<p>The ballistic computer is not directly accessed by the flight crew, but instead
pre-set based on the configured loadout by the ground crew to add the necessary

calculate accurate delivery.</p>
<h2 id="wrcs-built-in-test-bit"><a class="header" href="#wrcs-built-in-test-bit">WRCS Built-In-Test (BIT)</a></h2>
<p>The BIT control is used to confirm go/no-go status of the WRCS. The BIT system
checks individual bomb modes individually, and effectivity of the given setting
is confirmed by selecting the desired mode, pushing the center of the knob PUSH
FOR BIT for five seconds, then pressing the FREEZE button in conjunction wih the
PUSH FOR BIT button. Confirmation of mode performance will be displayed as GO or
NO-GO. Should a mode be checked a subsequent time during a flight and a NO-GO

<h2 id="cursor-control-panel-1"><a class="header" href="#cursor-control-panel-1">Cursor Control Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_cursor_control_panel.jpg" alt="wso_cursor_control_panel" /></p>
<p>The Cursor Control Panel provides the controls needed for TARGET FIND and OFFSET
bombing modes. The panel has two wheels named ALONG TRACK and CROSS TRACK,
which is used in the MAP-PPI mode to position their respective cursors over the
Radar Identification Point (from this point denoted as RIP). The ALONG TRACK
control, which presents relative range to the RIP, also includes an internal
switch enabling the cursor instructions to be acknowledged by the WRCS ballistic
computer, and must therefore be the first applied command in the target
insertion sequence.</p>
<p>Once the ALONG TRACK (range hemisphere) and CROSS TRACK (vertical line) cursors
are aligned over the RIP, the FREEZE button is pressed to initiate WRCS ground
path tracking of the specified point. The button remains illuminated until the
RESET button is pressed or another bombing mode is selected.</p>
<p>With WRCS ground tracking initiated, the TARGET INSERT button is pressed for the
ALONG TRACK and CROSS TRACK cursors to shift from the RIP to the offset target.
Once selected, target steering information is provided from the WRCS to the
BDHI, ADI, HSI, and optical sight. In the AGM-45 missile mode, the AoA Indexers
will provide maneuver commands for level, dive, or climb requirements to align
for seeker acquisition. Further, unless the WRCS Tone switch is disabled on the
ARBCS panel, an audio tone will be triggered from the point of bomb release
button press until the first bomb releases from the aircraft; this function is
nominally for training purposes, as it can preclude other system audio volume.</p>
<h2 id="weapon-delivery-panel-1"><a class="header" href="#weapon-delivery-panel-1">Weapon Delivery Panel</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_weapon_delivery_panel.jpg" alt="wso_weapon_delivery_panel" /></p>
<p>The Weapon Delivery Panel permits the aircrew to use the WRCS TGT FIND functions
in LABS (ARBCS) modes - those found on the left side of the pilot's Delivery Mode
Knob.</p>
<p>The TGT FIND switch on the panel functions the same as the TGT FIND mode on the
Delivery Mode Knob. The Delivery Mode Knob overrides this switch in any mode
outside of TGT FIND, and should be set back to NORM. The HOLD position energizes
the target finding circuits in conjunction with any LABS or DIRECT mode the pilot
selects.</p>
<p>The RANGE Switch is functional in any WRCS mode requiring a Release Range
setting. The NORM position applies the noted x10 multiplier on the displayed
Release setting, whereas selecting x100 applies a multiplier of 100 to the
counter value.</p>
<p>The ACTIVATE Switch triggers the prerequisite activation signals to the LABS
circuits once the aircraft has passed within the Release Range. The switch
should only be placed in ON after target insert has been pressed and the ALONG
TRACK and CROSS TRACK cursors have transitioned to the target.</p>

<p>The AN/AJB-7 ARBCS is the automated release control system for time or
pitch-relative bombing. Interfacing with the Multiple Weapon Controls, Pedestal
Panel weapon settings, and bomb, laser guided, or the AGM-45, the system
releases the selected munition once the respective Bombing Timer or respective
Bomb Release Angle Computer pitch angle (gyro) target has been achieved.</p>
<p>The left side of the Delivery Mode Knob selects the ARBCS release modes. Both
LOFT and T LAD modes provide weapons release in a pull-up, with LOFT selecting a
4.0 G pull-up schedule and weapon release on achieving a set gyro angle value,
whereas T LAD assumes a 3.5 G pull-up schedule and release at the end of the
Bombing Timer setting. Necessary values for Low and High angle, as well as the
Bombing Timer are found on the provided tables.</p>
<h2 id="bomb-release-angle-computer-1"><a class="header" href="#bomb-release-angle-computer-1">Bomb Release Angle Computer</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_bomb_release_angle.jpg" alt="wso_bomb_release_angle" /></p>
<p>The Bomb Release Angle Computer provides entry of the necessary target pitch
angles for ARBCS bombing modes. The values of HIGH (70 to 179.9 degrees) and LOW
(0 to 89.9 degrees) are controlled using their respective entry knobs.
Internally, the computer contains the release switches, as well as the resolver
to transmit the target angle values to the ADI director pointers.</p>
<p>A calculator for the input values in-game is provided by

<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/wso_bombing_timers.jpg" alt="wso_bomb_release_timer" /></p>
<p>Timers for ARBCS bombing modes are available for PULL-UP (0 to 60 seconds) and
RELEASE (0 to 30 seconds). Both can be set in increments of 0.1 second, with 0.1
second as the minimum setting. The reference windows do not count down during
the bomb run.</p>
<p>When the PULL-UP timer is complete, required PULL-UP signaling will initiate,
along with any ADI director programming to show proper flight path. RELEASE
timing is mode dependent, and will occur once PULL-UP is complete, if required.</p>
<p>In LOFT and O/S modes, only PULL-UP timing is activated, and a value must be set
to energize the ADI pull-up flight path program.</p>
<p>In T LAD and TL, PULL-UP and RELEASE are both activated, in sequence, and both
require a value entry- PULL-UP to energize the flight path programming, and
RELEASE to generate the munition release signal.</p>
<p>In integrated LABS (ARBCS)/WRCS bombing, the above requirements are the same,
however the WRCS initiates the bomb run timing, rather than pressing the bomb
button. When the WRCS initiates timing, an audio tone is applied to signal timer
start.</p>

<p>During ARBCS weapons delivery, a number of indicators are available to confirm
run initiation and at what step of the given run the aircraft is in:</p>
<ol>
<li>Upon run initiation (bomb button press/WRCS initiation) and PULL-UP timer
start, the Pull-up light turns ON.
<img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/pilot_pull_up_light.jpg" alt="pilot_pull_up_timer" /></li>
<li>At PULL-UP timer completion, the Pull-up light turns OFF, the reticle light
turns OFF, and a steady Pull-up Tone (if switched ON) occurs.</li>
<li>As release pitch angle is attained, the Pull-up light turns ON, the reticle
light turns ON, and the Pull-up Tone stops.</li>
<li>When the bomb button is released, Pull-up light turns OFF.</li>
</ol>
<p>This indication sequence can occur with the master arm in SAFE for training
purposes.</p>

<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/../../img/pilot_gyro_fast_erect.jpg" alt="pilot_gyro_fast_erect" /></p>
<p>Due to rapid maneuvering during a bombing run, gyro deviation can occur due to
fluid migration. While this deviation will resolve naturally at a rate of 1 to 2
degrees correction per minute over time, it can quickly be corrected by using the
FAST ERECT switch found in the front pilot cockpit on the left side console, at
a rate of 15 degrees per minute. This switch should not be held for more than 60
seconds, or damage can occur to the gyro.</p>

<p>The AN/AVQ-23 Pave Spike targeting pod is the successor of the AN/AVQ-10 Pave
Knife and predecessor of the AN/AVQ-26 Pave Tack pod. It entered service in 1974
and was replaced from 1982 to 1989 by the Pave Tack pod. It provides a slew-able
TV image for spotting ground targets and can fire laser for determining range
information and to guide laser guided weapons.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_screen_example.jpg" alt="pave_spike_screen_example" /></p>
<p>The line of sight can be controlled by the WSO, using the Antenna Hand Control.
The camera image is displayed on the DSCG scope and can be viewed by both, the
Pilot and the WSO independently.</p>
<h2 id="targeting-pod"><a class="header" href="#targeting-pod">Targeting Pod</a></h2>
<p>The system has an optical camera for daylight operation with one level of

<h2 id="symbology"><a class="header" href="#symbology">Symbology</a></h2>
<p>The TV image mainly consists of a reticle. The reticle rotates clockwise to
indicate the pods current elevation. At a 90 degree rotation, the pod is looking
straight down. If the reticle is almost upside down, the pod reached its gimbal
limit for the elevation (160 degrees).</p>
<p>The wide field of view is indicated by a circle around the reticle.</p>
<p>On the left, the image displays two cues:</p>
<ul>

<p>The Mode-Knob allows the pilot to select one of two weapon delivery modes
available with the pod:</p>
<ul>
<li>WRCS - Automatic Delivery</li>
<li>ROR - Release on Range</li>
</ul>
<p>In the SET position, the display shows the desired release range used in the ROR

<h3 id="laser-coder-control-1"><a class="header" href="#laser-coder-control-1">Laser Coder Control</a></h3>
<p>The WSO can set the laser code used by the targeting pod by using the four small

one. Once a code has been set, it can be transferred to the Pave Spike by
pressing the Enter-Button to the right.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/laser_coder_control.jpg" alt="laser_coder_control" /></p>
<p>The Laser Coder system starts validating the entered code, this process takes
about 5 seconds. If the NO-GO lamp is lit, the code is invalid.</p>
<p>Codes directly relate to lasers frequencies, resulting in them having to be
between 1111 and 1788 and not use digits 0 or 9 in order to be valid.</p>
<p>When power is applied to the system, it automatically initiates a transfer of
the currently set code.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="modes"><a class="header" href="#modes">Modes</a></h1>
<p>Prior to being able to designate a target, one has to visually acquire the
general target area and put the LOS in the vicinity. This is done by using one
of three acquisition modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>12-VIS</li>
<li>9-VIS</li>
<li>WRCS</li>
</ul>
<p>The modes can be selected by the WSO, using the Acquisition Mode Switch.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/acq_mode_switch.jpg" alt="acq_mode_switch" /></p>
<h2 id="visual-modes"><a class="header" href="#visual-modes">Visual modes</a></h2>
<p>In 12-VIS and 9-VIS, the LOS is set to a fix position.</p>
<ul>
<li>12-VIS: 0 degrees roll, -2 degrees elevation, looking slightly nose down</li>
<li>9-VIS: -90 degrees roll (CW), -90 degrees elevation (down), looking left</li>
</ul>
<p>12-VIS can be a great way to find targets of opportunity, as it allows the pilot
to put a target directly on the nose. The position also corresponds to the caged
HUD reticle. Additionally, if the INS is integrated with the pod, 12-VIS is
roll-stabilized.</p>
<p>The use of 9-VIS is very limited. It is intended to aid in acquiring a target
while observing an area in a turn. The target has to be put on the extension of
the left wing. However, in practice it is very difficult to maintain a turn in
such an attitude.</p>
<h2 id="wrcs-mode"><a class="header" href="#wrcs-mode">WRCS mode</a></h2>
<p>The main mode to acquire targets is the WRCS mode, in which the LOS is set to
the current WRCS target. This usually corresponds to the cursor on the radar
screen, but can also be set manually by the WSO. This enables the crew to spot a
target, or general target area, by using the radar or entering known coordinates
and then slewing the pod to this destination. If no specific target has been
inserted, the WRCS usually defaults to the aircraft position, resulting in the
pod looking straight down.</p>
<p>The WRCS mode automatically falls back to the 12-VIS mode in case the WRCS
integration is deactivated.</p>
<h2 id="track-mode"><a class="header" href="#track-mode">Track mode</a></h2>
<p>Once the target, or general target area, has been found using the acquisition
modes, the WSO can enter Track-mode by pressing the trigger on the Antenna Hand
Control to either Half or Full Action.</p>
<p>In this mode, the Antenna Stick can be moved to slew the pod LOS. Operating the
laser is only available in this mode, and can be activated by pressing the
trigger on the Antenna Stick to Full Action.</p>
<p>Track mode is indicated by the T0 and TTG cues becoming visible on the display.
They also indicate the status during laser operation.</p>
<p>If the INS is integrated with the pod, the image will automatically be space
stabilized on the computed target position. Be aware that the stabilization is
rudimentary and needs constant correction with the stick for the target to be
kept centered.</p>
<p>The stabilization is mostly based on the measured slant range. Accurate slant
range can be obtained by firing the laser. Alternatively, it is computed based
on the aircraft barometric altitude and the target altitude, which can be set by
the WSO on the WRCS panel.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_wrcs_target_alt.jpg" alt="pave_spike_wrcs_target_alt" /></p>
<p>Without a WRCS integration, a target altitude of 0 is assumed, degrading the
stabilization.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The pod is not capable of computing a slant range for targets above
the own aircraft altitude (for example when attacking up-hill). Since that is
measured using the barometric altitude, depending on the pressure-setting, this
can lead to erratic behavior during hot days when flying low. Problematic
situations like this were commonly referred to as <em>Idiot mode</em>, as the tracking
system started to behave very odd and it was very difficult to restore proper
behavior. The crew often had to deactivate the INS integration temporarily in
order to disable the automatic tracking.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="memory-mode"><a class="header" href="#memory-mode">Memory Mode</a></h2>
<p>Whenever a target-insert signal is send, the system activates the Memory-mode,
provided it is currently in Track-mode and the WRCS integration is active.</p>
<p>In this mode, the line of sight is slaved to the current WRCS target, even if it
is outside of the pods gimbal limits and cannot be displayed currently. The mode
acts very similar to the WRCS-Acquisition mode.</p>
<p>The memory mode has to be left explicitly again, by either pressing half or full
action on the Antenna Stick.</p>
<h3 id="target-insert"><a class="header" href="#target-insert">Target Insert</a></h3>
<p>A target-insert signal is usually initiated by the WSO pressing the
target-insert button.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wrcs_target_insert_button.jpg" alt="wrcs_target_insert_button" /></p>
<p>However, when the pod is currently in Track-mode and is maneuvered outside of
its gimbal limits, it will automatically initiate a target-insert signal and
send its current target position to the WRCS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 If the laser is currently firing, it will automatically be stopped
when hitting a limit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This signal then also causes the pod to enter Memory-mode, in which case it will
continue to follow the position now memorized by the WRCS.</p>
<p>Additionally, the signal will also be send if the pod is deselected, i.e.</p>
<ul>
<li>Video Select Switch - Weapon, or</li>
<li>WSO DSCG Mode - not TV (for example switching to Radar)</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="laser-system"><a class="header" href="#laser-system">Laser System</a></h1>
<p>The laser can only be operated in the Track-mode and serves two purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guiding laser guided weapons on a target,</li>
<li>and accurate slant range measurement.</li>
</ul>
<p>Slant range is, besides weapon impact calculations, used for the automatic
target stabilization in Track-mode. If not measured with the laser, it is
computed based on inaccurate INS and WRCS data, resulting in a degradation of
the system.</p>
<p>The laser can be used when the LASER READY lamp is illuminated.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/laser_ready_lamp.jpg" alt="laser_ready_lamp" /></p>
<p>To setup the laser, a valid code has to first be entered on the Laser Coder
Control panel and transferred to the pod by pressing the Enter-Button. Make sure
that the NO GO light is not illuminated.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/laser_coder_control.jpg" alt="laser_coder_control" /></p>
<p>The LASER READY push button has to be pushed in for the laser to be armed.</p>
<p>Additionally, the laser is guarded by the nose gear position, which has to be
fully retracted to prevent accidental use on the ground.</p>
<p>Once ready, the laser is fired during track mode by pressing full action on the
Antenna Stick. The status of the laser operation is indicated by the cues on the
display being steady or flashing.</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Indication</th><th>T0</th><th>TTG</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</div>
<p>The T0 cue indicates intention to fire the laser, while the TTG cue represents
the outcome of the laser usage.</p>
<p>The slant range measured by the laser is compared to the slant range computed
based on INS and WRCS data. If it is not within ±20% percent of that value, it
is rejected. This is indicated by TTG flashing slow.</p>
<p>The system can be forced to use the laser range regardless, by pressing the
Reject/Override Button.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/reject_override_button.jpg" alt="reject_override_button" /></p>
<p>In practice, laser measured range is much more accurate than the slant range
computed by the system. Hence, pilots developed a habit of always hitting the
button whenever they fired the laser.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="weapon-release-modes"><a class="header" href="#weapon-release-modes">Weapon Release Modes</a></h1>
<p>The pod offers two additional weapon release modes:</p>
<ul>
<li>WRCS Auto Mode</li>
<li>ROR (Release on Range)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="auto-mode"><a class="header" href="#auto-mode">Auto Mode</a></h2>
<p>The main method of weapon delivery with the pod is the WRCS automatic release
mode.</p>
<p>The WRCS has to be integrated with the pod for it to be available, and the pilot
must select TGT FIND as delivery mode, as well as WRCS on the range indicator.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_weapon_sel_tgt_find.jpg" alt="pave_spike_weapon_sel_tgt_find" />
<img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_range_mode_wrcs.jpg" alt="pave_spike_range_mode_wrcs" /></p>
<p>This mode works the same as the Dive Toss mode of the WRCS, just that it will
use the pods computed slant range and target instead.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/wrcs_auto_release_procedure.jpg" alt="wrcs_auto_release_procedure" /></p>
<p>The TTG cue will move down and meet the T0 cue to indicate the time to release.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/ttg_moes_to_tt0.jpg" alt="TTg moves down to T0" /></p>
<h2 id="ror"><a class="header" href="#ror">ROR</a></h2>
<p>Release on range is mostly a backup mode. The pilot must select TGT FIND as
delivery mode, and ROR on the range indicator.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_weapon_sel_tgt_find.jpg" alt="pave_spike_weapon_sel_tgt_find" />
<img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_range_mode_ror.jpg" alt="pave_spike_range_mode_ror" /></p>
<p>Weapons will be released automatically, as soon as the computed slant range is
less than the set desired release range. The range is configured on the range
indicator, by setting the mode to SET and rotating the knob below the display.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_ror_controls.jpg" alt="pave_spike_ror_controls" /></p>
<p>Best results are achieved during level flight.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="other"><a class="header" href="#other">Other</a></h1>
<h2 id="stowing"><a class="header" href="#stowing">Stowing</a></h2>
<p>After turning on the system, the pod can be un-stowed by pressing the STOW push
button.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/stow_lamp.jpg" alt="stow_lamp" /></p>
<p>When un-stowed, the pod moves according to the current selections and
automatically goes into the WIDE FOV.</p>
<p>In the stowed position, the camera is rotated upwards and a cover is moved in
front of it. This protects the camera from stones and other hazards during taxi,
takeoff or low level flight.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_stowed.jpg" alt="pave_spike_stowed" /></p>
<p>The stow-procedure takes about 5 seconds, with the light indicating the current
status.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The stow-position is held electrically and can not be held without
power. Un-powered, the pod swings freely with force. Taking off without first
applying power to the pod, or flying with the pod being powered off, will cause
the pod to leave the stow position. Outside of the stow position, the system
will get damaged through hazards and whenever it is forcefully moved into its
gimbal limits. Damage will not only offset the boresight position, but also
affect other properties, such as movement speed and similar.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="cooling"><a class="header" href="#cooling">Cooling</a></h2>
<p>The targeting pod has a cooling system installed in the rear section, which
automatically cools the pod by external airflow.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_cooling.jpg" alt="pave_spike_cooling" /></p>
<p>In general, the system is capable of keeping the pods temperature within limits
during all normal operation.</p>
<p>However, if the temperature gets out of control, the Overheat lamp will
illuminate.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/overheat_lamp.jpg" alt="overheat_lamp" /></p>
<p>In this case, make sure to turn off the pod immediately and give it some time to
cool down first. Ignoring the lamp will cause parts of the pod to melt, damaging
it irreparably.</p>
<p>A broken pod is generally indicated by the MALF lamp going on and the display
being all black.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_melted.jpg" alt="pave_spike_melted" /></p>
<p>To prolong use of the pod and prevent overheating, limit slow and low-level
flight, as well as continuous use of the laser. As a rule-of-thumb, do not use
the laser for longer than 15 minutes without allowing for cooling between uses.
Limit continued slow and low level flight while operating the pod to 30 minutes.
For extreme outside temperatures, adjust the limits accordingly.</p>
<h2 id="bits"><a class="header" href="#bits">BITs</a></h2>
<p>The pod has 5 built-in tests, with BIT 1 being the actual mode used during
normal operation. They can be activated and switched through by clicking the BIT
button below the display. The GO/MALF lights show the result of the BIT:</p>
<ul>
<li>GO - test was successful</li>
<li>MALF - test detected a failure</li>
</ul>
<p>During normal operation, activated through BIT 1, neither of the lights are
illuminated.</p>
<h3 id="bit-0"><a class="header" href="#bit-0">BIT 0</a></h3>
<p>All lights on the Target Designator Set Control illuminate with full brightness.
The pod does not need to be powered up for this test.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_self_test.jpg" alt="pave_spike_self_test" /></p>
<p>GO/MALF do not indicate test results in this mode.</p>
<h3 id="bit-1"><a class="header" href="#bit-1">BIT 1</a></h3>
<p>The circuits are energized and monitored. If any voltage reading is abnormal,
MALF illuminates.</p>
<p>GO does not illuminate in this mode.</p>
<p>This is the standard operational mode. The pod can be used normally and the
system will continuously monitor the status.</p>
<h3 id="bit-2"><a class="header" href="#bit-2">BIT 2</a></h3>
<p>The system simulates track functionality, simulating all inputs, altitude and
range data.</p>
<p>After about 15 seconds, the test is finished with either GO or MALF
illuminating.</p>
<p>For the test to be successful, the aircraft must not be moving, the pod must be
un-stowed and INS must be integrated.</p>
<h3 id="bit-3"><a class="header" href="#bit-3">Bit 3</a></h3>
<p>This tests the laser energy level. The pod moves to a special position where it
looks inside itself, such that the laser fires against a special sensor mounted
inside the pod.</p>
<p>The pod must be un-stowed and a valid laser code must have been entered, as well
as the LASER READY button being pushed in. The nose gear guard is ignored during
the test, allowing the use of the laser on ground.</p>
<p>Once the pod has reached the test position, the WSO must press and hold the
Reject/Override button to start firing the laser. The laser stops firing when
the button is released.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/reject_override_button.jpg" alt="reject_override_button" /></p>
<p>When the laser fires, a 5 second test program starts, with the sensor measuring
the laser energy. After the 5 second test, either GO or MALF illuminate to
indicate whether the energy level was above the required minimum.</p>
<p>To pilot can assist in telling the WSO that the test position has been reached,
as indicated by the Azimuth-Elevation Indicator.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_bit_3_az_el.jpg" alt="pave_spike_bit_3_az_el" /></p>
<h3 id="bit-4"><a class="header" href="#bit-4">Bit 4</a></h3>
<p>The system tests the ranging computation by feeding a simulated laser slant
range of 2100 ft (±200). The pilot can confirm this using the Range Indicator
readout.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/pave_spike_bit_4_range.jpg" alt="pave_spike_bit_4_range" /></p>
<p>After about 8 to 14 seconds, the test is finished and either GO or MALF is lit.</p>
<h2 id="upgrades"><a class="header" href="#upgrades">Upgrades</a></h2>
<p>Based on crew feedback, the Pave Spike targeting pod received two major
upgrades, which are available as separate selectable weapon in DCS.</p>
<h3 id="smart-track"><a class="header" href="#smart-track">Smart-Track</a></h3>
<p>TCTO 518, known as the Smart-Track upgrade, aims at removing the requirement to
press the Reject/Override button to force the laser measured slant range in
situations in which the computed slant range was usually too inaccurate.</p>
<p><img src="systems/weapon_systems/pave_spike/../../../img/reject_override_button.jpg" alt="reject_override_button" /></p>
<p>With the upgrade, the system will automatically accept the laser slant range
whenever the pods elevation gimbal is above -7.5 degrees. I.e. in shallow
angles, for example during 12-VIS mode or low altitude attacks.</p>
<h3 id="fast-track"><a class="header" href="#fast-track">Fast-Track</a></h3>
<p>The popular upgrade TCTO 519 overhauls the pods gimbal motors, increasing the
movement speed from 15 dps to 60 dps.</p>
<p>At this speed, the targeting pod is capable of tracking a target during low
altitude high speed flight, such as overflights at 1,000 ft with 500 knots.</p>

<p>The AN/ALE-40 countermeasures dispenser set provides the capability of
dispensing RR-170 A/AL chaff cartridges or MJU-7/B infrared flare cartridges, or
a combination of both. The system consists of four chaff dispensers, or a
combination of two chaff dispensers and two flare dispensers located on the
inboard armament pylons; a programmer and flares select switch in the pilot
cockpit; a cockpit control unit (CCU) in the WSO cockpit; indicator lights
located in both front and rear cockpit; and a dispense button located both in
the pilot and the WSO cockpit. The circuit breaker for the ALE-40 is located on
the No.4 Circuit Breaker Panel above the aft left console in the WSO cockpit.</p>

</div>
<p>Dispensing of countermeasures can be initiated by either the pilot or the WSO
from either the front or the rear cockpit. The CCU will initiate the various
modes of operation. The programmer will generate the firing commands in
different combinations called bursts or salvos. A group of several bursts
constitutes a salvo. The pylon mounted dispensers will convert the firing
commands to individually sequenced firing signals. If the operation mode is set
to chaff, the dispensing will start in the left pylon dispenser and then
transfer the dispensing signals to the right pylon dispenser upon depletion of
stores in the left dispenser. If the operation mode is set to flare, dispensing
will start in the right pylon master dispenser and upon depletion of stores the
sequencer switch will transfer the dispensing signal to the left master
dispenser. Flares can also be jettisoned from their dispensers at a rate of 10
flares per second by activating the ripple switch located on the CCU.</p>

<p>The AN/ALE-40 countermeasures dispensers are divided into two distinct dispenser
configurations. The master (outboard) dispenser contains the electronics and
sequencer switch for both dispensers on each pylon and is installed on the
outboard side of the inboard armament pylons. The slave (inboard) dispenser is
installed on the inboard side of the inboard armament pylons and is connected to
the master dispenser by an interconnect cable. The aircraft can be configured
either with four chaff payload modules on all four dispensers or two chaff
payload modules on the slave dispensers and two flare payload modules on the
master dispensers. Only chaff payload modules can be installed on the slave
dispensers; flare payload modules can only be installed on the master
dispensers.</p>
<h3 id="master-dispenser-assembly"><a class="header" href="#master-dispenser-assembly">Master Dispenser Assembly</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Operation of the master dispenser assembly is done automatically by the
ground crew in DCS, according to the AN/ALE-40 loadout selected in the loadout
menu.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One master dispenser assembly is installed on the outboard side of each inboard
armament pylon. It consists of a sequencer switch, a breech assembly, a
RESET/OPERATE circuit breaker switch, a payload control switch, a safety pin
switch with safety pin and warning streamer and relevant electrical circuitry.
The sequencer switch converts the firing commands into individual firing signals
for each pyrotechnic squib in both the master and slave dispensers. The breech
assembly provides the interface to mount the chaff or flare payload modules.
Insertion of the safety pin removes electrical power to both pylon mounted
dispensers. After a full chaff or flare module has been loaded, the
RESET/OPERATE switch is placed in OPERATE. The chaff or flare sections will fire
in sequence. After flight, if a partial load of chaff or flares remains, the
switch should be left in OPERATE. If the switch is moved to RESET, the empty
chaff or flare stations have to be stepped through before loaded stations will
fire. The payload selector switch positions C (chaff) and F (flare) only define
the master dispenser mode of deployment and are set automatically in DCS
according to the selected loadout.</p>
<h3 id="slave-dispenser-assembly"><a class="header" href="#slave-dispenser-assembly">Slave Dispenser Assembly</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The payload selector switch position is set to CS (chaff single dispense)
by default in DCS. To set it to CD (chaff double dispense), you have to do so
either in the Mission Editor Unit Aircraft Additional Options tab or in the
kneeboard. This action can only be performed on the ground and/or before mission
start.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One slave dispenser assembly is installed on the inboard side of each inboard
armament pylon. It contains a payload selector switch to set either chaff single
or chaff double dispense, a breech assembly and relevant electrical circuitry.
If the payload selector switch is left in the default CS position, one chaff
cartridge will be dispensed for each chaff burst commanded. If the payload
selector switch is set to the CD position, two chaff cartridges will be
dispensed simultaneously, one from each dispenser, for each chaff burst
commanded. The breech assembly provides the interface to mount the chaff payload
module.</p>
<h3 id="flare-housing-adapter"><a class="header" href="#flare-housing-adapter">Flare Housing Adapter</a></h3>
<p>The flare housing adapter is installed between the master dispenser assembly and
the flare payload module. The wedge shaped adapter ensures that the flares will
be ejected aft and down from the aircraft. It cannot be mounted to the slave
dispenser.</p>
<h3 id="chaff-payload-module-and-cartridges"><a class="header" href="#chaff-payload-module-and-cartridges">Chaff Payload Module and Cartridges</a></h3>
<p>The chaff payload module is attached to the master or slave dispenser breech
assembly with four quick release fasteners. The chaff cartridge consists of a
basic plastic sleeve, chaff dipoles and a plastic end cap. When dispensed the
chaff dipoles are ejected from the sleeves and leave the disposable sleeve and
empty squib case behind. The cartridge base provides a recess for the chaff
pyrotechnic squib.</p>
<p>WARNING: Accidental discharge of the chaff cartridges can cause injury to
personnel or damage to the aircraft. The master dispenser safety pin must be
installed at all times when loading, unloading or maintaining the system.</p>

of a metal outer sleeve, a flare element, a safe-ing and initiation device and a
plastic end cap. An indentation in the cartridge base allows for proper flare
installation.</p>
<p>WARNING: Accidental discharge of the flare cartridges can cause injury to

a pair of directional antennas installed at the aft of the fuselage; the difference in relative
timing of detection and angle by the antennas is used by the system to define a relative bearing to
the emitting radar. Further processing of the received radiation references the stored threat
catalog to ascertain emitter type, as well as to define a relative threat range as a function of
received power versus known output.</p>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/RWRAz.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr" /></p>
<p>The resulting processed threat signal is then presented on the RWR's CRT display, with bearing to
the emitter shown on the display with the top relative to the nose (12 o'clock) and the bottom the
tail (6 o'clock), and with proximity to center relative to the system's calculation of the level of
threat - with closer indications being of higher danger, and those within the middle ring being
classified within engagement range. In normal operation, the ALR-46 can present 16 threats on the
CRT concurrently. The highest priority threat as computed by the ALR-46's threat and range catalog
is presented on the display with a diamond superimposed by its symbol; this is considered &quot;floating&quot;
diamond functionality, with the ALR-46 defining priority. In the event of possible engagement by a
threat emitter (concurrent with the illumination of the ACTIVITY and/or MISSILE LAUNCH buttons), the
event is signified by a circle around the emitter symbol.</p>

<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/wso_an_apr_36.jpg" alt="pilot_rwr_control_panel" /></p>
<h3 id="rwr-display-intensity-knob"><a class="header" href="#rwr-display-intensity-knob">RWR Display Intensity Knob</a></h3>
<p>Found adjacent to the RWR situation display in the lower left corner of the panel, the Intensity
Knob functions as a dimmer to control the brightness of the displayed RWR returns. Clockwise raises
the brightness, counter-clockwise lowers the brightness.</p>
<h3 id="alr-46-control-panel"><a class="header" href="#alr-46-control-panel">ALR-46 Control Panel</a></h3>
<p>The ALR-46 Control Panel consists of ten multipurpose, illuminated buttons, along with a pair of
rotary knobs for controlling the system's volume and panel brightness.</p>
<h3 id="priorityopen"><a class="header" href="#priorityopen">Priority/Open</a></h3>
<p>The ALR-46 defaults on power-up to OPEN mode, which presents up to 16 threats on the display at one
time, depending on how many emitters are visible and current system settings (Search, LOW ALT,
etc.). In the event the crew requires immediate prioritization of the most pressing threats in a
saturated environment, the PRIORITY button can be pressed to display the five emitters the system
deems the most dangerous. When pressed, the OPEN illumination will swap to the PRIORITY position,
and revert back upon selection back to OPEN.</p>
<h3 id="s-search"><a class="header" href="#s-search">S (Search)</a></h3>
<p>By default, the ALR-46 is programmed to prioritize and display emitters tied to weapons that can
engage and destroy the aircraft. However, missions will require monitoring of early warning and
search radar systems working with longer pulse-widths for extended range detection and tracking of
possible intruders- ie, the F-4. These emitters can be displayed using the Search mode, which
presents them on the RWR with the S symbol to signify their function as a long range search radar.
Entry into Search mode is displayed on the button with an illuminated &quot;S&quot;.</p>
<p>Because of their low threat priority, is important to note that search radar symbology may often
fall off the display due to their reduced importance - especially when the ALR-46 is placed into
PRIORITY mode.</p>
<h3 id="handoff-h-with--diamond"><a class="header" href="#handoff-h-with--diamond">Handoff (H with &lt;&gt; Diamond)</a></h3>
<p>The Handoff button provides the opportunity for the flight crew to define the priority emitting
threat. By default, the ALR-46 defines the highest priority threat as a function of range, current
transmitting mode, and the threat catalog. This priority threat is visualized with a diamond
superimposed around the emitter's symbol. In the event the pilot wishes to define a different emitter
as the target, the Handoff button is pressed and held to cycle the priority diamond through the
various emitters. Once the desired emitter is focused upon and surrounded with the diamond, the
button can be released, and the priority symbol will remain latched with that emitter, with audio
from the selected emitter played through the intercom, and the double carat (&lt;&gt;) symbol on the
button illuminated to signify latched mode. With a latched diamond focus emitter, the system will
remain focused on said emitter until the signal is either lost, the crew elects another focus
emitter with the Handoff button, or the button is pressed momentarily to return to normal floating
diamond threat priority mode.</p>
<p>In the event that the emitter is tight grouping of other symbols on the display, the TGT SEP mode
will be applied.</p>
<h3 id="missile-launch"><a class="header" href="#missile-launch">Missile Launch</a></h3>
<p>In the event a missile launch is detected by way of discrete SAM guidance commands being received,
the MISSILE LAUNCH indications in this button will illuminate, and a circle is superimposed around
the threat emitter defined as guiding the inbound weapon. Pressing the button while illuminated will
provide launch audio through the intercom.</p>
<h3 id="low-altitude-low-alt"><a class="header" href="#low-altitude-low-alt">Low Altitude (LOW ALT)</a></h3>
<p>The ALR-46 utilizes own-ship altitude as a defining aspect of threat priority, thus causing low
altitude AAA and SAM threats to lose priority in the event the aircraft is at an altitude that is
estimated to place it outside of their threat envelope. Activating LOW ALT mode removes this
envelope estimate from the threat prioritization and places low altitude threats back into priority,
useful for circumstances such as a high to low dive attack or target ingress profile, and is
confirmed as the active mode with the illuminated LOW ALT descriptor on the button.</p>
<h3 id="target-separate-tgt-sep"><a class="header" href="#target-separate-tgt-sep">Target Separate (TGT SEP)</a></h3>
<p>In the event of a number of emitters being detected at such close proximity that the symbology
overlaps on the RWR display, the Target Separation button provides the option to expand symbology on
the display from emitters in the same area to allow for clarity on the type and number of radars
being detected. Pressing the button triggers the lower TGT SEP illumination on the button, and any
emitter groups the system defines as being eligible for the expanded presentation will do so for
three seconds on the RWR display before reverting back to the standard view.</p>
<h3 id="system-test-onsys-test"><a class="header" href="#system-test-onsys-test">System Test (ON/SYS TEST)</a></h3>
<p>The system power on test provides a three band (1 low, 2 mid, 3 high) check in all four quadrants
for proper sensitivity, along with a three angle (45, 135, and 315) confirmation of relative bearing
for diagnostic purposes. The test sequence begins with 1s in all four quadrants, with the upper left
value in a diamond (signifying a heading of 45, which is displayed on the panel); the second and
third continue this process, cycling band 2 with the lower right in the diamond (for 135), and band
3 with the upper left 3 in the diamond (for 315). The tests are accompanied with a sequence of tones
for adjustment of audio monitoring level.</p>
<h3 id="unknown-u"><a class="header" href="#unknown-u">Unknown (U)</a></h3>
<p>When an emitter is detected that does not have a catalog entry, but is recognized by received power,
duration, and pulse as being a possible threat, the U indicator on the Unknown button will flash.
Pressing the button will provide a U symbol on the RWR CRT at the correct azimuth position for
reference and monitoring.</p>
<p>The default condition of the Unknown button is with the U symbol illuminated, but steady.</p>
<h3 id="activity-power"><a class="header" href="#activity-power">Activity Power</a></h3>
<p>In the event SAM guidance commands are detected, the ACTIVITY button will illuminate. This button's
function is similar to the MISSILE LAUNCH indication insofar as that it responds to a guidance
directive to a SAM, but does not respond to discrete changeover signals. Thus, an illuminated
ACTIVITY warning may in fact indicate a launch, depending on the system engaging the F-4 and the
circumstances surrounding it. The indication will provide a circle around the threat emitter.</p>
<h3 id="system-power"><a class="header" href="#system-power">System Power</a></h3>
<p>The System Power button is the on/off switch for the ALR-46. When pressed to activate the system,
the RWR control panel and display will cycle through their initial 9-second warmup, with the display
and illuminated buttons undergoing rapid flashing as the system is prepared for use and proper
functioning is confirmed. Search mode is deactivated by default upon startup, and if in the event
the aircraft was powered down and restarted, the altitude priority mode (LOW ALT or normal) will be
in the same state it was left prior to shut down.</p>
<p>In the event of a system power failure, the ALR-46 has an automatic restart function. Once power is
recovered, the receiver will restart after a fifteen-second delay, in addition to its 9-second power
on self test. The system will resume state in the same fashion as a normal restart - with Search
mode deactivated and the altitude priority as when power was lost.</p>
<h3 id="excess-noise-strobe-indicators"><a class="header" href="#excess-noise-strobe-indicators">Excess Noise Strobe Indicators</a></h3>
<p>During normal operation, a trio of three T shaped indicators appear in the 9, 12, and 3 o'clock
positions near the center of the RWR CRT. These indicators signify the absence of excess noise in
the low (9), mid (12), and high (3) band amplifier detection. In the event noise becomes too
significant in a given amplifier channel, the indicator for the respective band will disappear.
Should this occur, a SYS TEST can be performed to confirm the channel is still functioning; in the
event of a pass, the channel can be considered working at a reduced detection capacity.</p>
<p>A fourth indicator may appear as part of the SYS TEST or power up cycle. This fourth indicator in
the 6 o'clock position does not signify any function.</p>
<h3 id="audio-knob"><a class="header" href="#audio-knob">Audio Knob</a></h3>
<p>The AUDIO Knob is the direct volume control for the situational audio from the ALR-46. Turning the
knob clockwise increases the audio volume, turning counter-clockwise lowers the audio volume.</p>
<h3 id="dim-knob-dimmer"><a class="header" href="#dim-knob-dimmer">DIM Knob (Dimmer)</a></h3>
<p>The DIM knob on the ALR-46 control panel manages the brightness setting of the illuminated control
buttons; turning the knob clockwise increases the brightness, counter-clockwise reduces the
brightness.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="electronic-countermeasure"><a class="header" href="#electronic-countermeasure">Electronic Countermeasure</a></h1>
<p>The Phantom can be equipped with ECM pods capable of jamming radar signals to
protect it from getting tracked by other aircraft or radar guided missiles.</p>
<p>During its service, it saw a number of pods with different capabilities, for
example:</p>
<ul>
<li>AN/ALQ-71</li>
<li>AN/ALQ-72</li>
<li>AN/ALQ-87</li>
<li>AN/ALQ-101</li>
<li>AN/ALQ-119</li>
<li>AN/ALQ-131</li>
<li>AN/ALQ-162</li>
<li>AN/ALQ-184</li>
</ul>
<p>Early pods such as the AN/ALQ-71 or AN/ALQ-87 have been used effectively during
the Vietnam war. During mid 1970s, mostly AN/ALQ-119 and AN/ALQ-131 have been in
service.</p>
<p>The Phantom supports ECM pods on the two inboard pylons (stations 4 and 6) and
the inner wing pylons (stations 2 and 8). However, the ECM signals are connected
in a chain on each side respectively, only allowing control of one jammer pod
per side. Additionally, many pods have restrictions only allowing them to be
loaded on a single specific pylon. For example, AN/ALQ-119 and AN/ALQ-131 may only
be equipped on the left inboard pylon (station 4), requiring the crew to choose
between the Pave Spike targeting pod and a jammer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Due to engine limitations, effectiveness of all jammers in DCS are identical.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="controls-1"><a class="header" href="#controls-1">Controls</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/ecm.jpg" alt="ecm" /></p>
<p>The electronic counter-measurement systems are all controlled by
the WSO via controls on the right sub-panel.</p>
<p>The controls are duplicated for any pod carried on the left stations (4 or 2)
and for the right stations (6 and 8) respectively.</p>
<p>Interpretation of the modes, techniques and exact operation of the lights
depend on the loaded jammer model.</p>
<p>Generally, the jammers differentiate between two modes or techniques that can be used.
Both of which usually have a warmup phase indicated by the Standby Lights on the panel.</p>
<p>The knob can be used to place either technique in Standby or, once ready,
activate transmission (XMIT 1, XMIT 2, BOTH).</p>
<p>Some jammers models can also detect that they are actively jamming an enemy radar,
indicated by the AI light.</p>
<h3 id="reset-button-and-lamp-1"><a class="header" href="#reset-button-and-lamp-1">Reset Button and Lamp</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/wso_ecm_reset.jpg" alt="ecm" /></p>
<p>The reset lamp, if lit, indicates a fault in the jammer system.
Flashing indicates an overheating condition, in which case the pod
should be turned off to prevent damage.</p>
<p>In case of a fault, the reset button can be pressed to reset the
jammer system (similar to turning it OFF and back ON), in which case it will
run through the warmup period again. If the fault could be cleared, the light will go off.</p>
<h2 id="analq-131"><a class="header" href="#analq-131">AN/ALQ-131</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/defensive_systems/../../img/jammer_131.jpg" alt="AN/ALQ-131" /></p>
<p>In service between 1970 and 1990; may only be equipped on the left inboard station 4.</p>
<p>Technique 1 and 2 are identical and require a warmup period of around 3 minutes
before being activated.</p>
<p>The warmup logic is hardwired - flipping the pod off and on, or having a
short loss of power, will result in the full warmup period being required again before use.</p>
<p>The pod can overheat, in which case the fault lamp will blink. To prevent issues with
high temperature, limit its use during slow and low altitude flights.</p>

<p><img src="systems/../img/pilot_master_caution.jpg" alt="pilot_master_caution" /></p>
<p>Found in the front cockpit, the MASTER CAUTION provides the pilot with an
up-front warning of potential hazard to the aircraft. The MASTER CAUTION
illuminates concurrently with most warning lamps on the telelight panel and the
generator indicators; warnings that do not set off MASTER CAUTION are noted in
the Telelight Panel list.</p>
<p>MASTER CAUTION can be deactivated by the pilot pressing the reset button on the
right console. However, it is important to note that pressing MASTER CAUTION
does not clear a warning on the telelight panel; instead, the warning will
remain until rectified. Should a second event occur in a system already giving a
telelight warning, MASTER CAUTION will not illuminate a second time.</p>

<p><img src="systems/../img/pilot_warning_light_test_switch.jpg" alt="pilot_warning_light_test_switch" /></p>
<p>Confirmation of bulb function can be performed using the Warning Test Light
Circuit found on the interior light control panel in both cockpits. These do not
perform a function text for the individual warning systems, only confirm that
the lights will illuminate.</p>

<p><img src="systems/../img/pilot_fire_test.jpg" alt="pilot_engine_fire_test_group" /></p>
<p>On the right upper instrument panel in the front cockpit are four warning lamps-
two FIRE and two OVRHEAT lights, one for each side. Should a fire be detected in
an engine compartment, the applicable FIRE lap will illuminate. Overheat
detectors are mounted at the rear of the fuselage adjacent to the engine
nozzles, and illuminate the respective OVRHEAT lamp should temperatures become
dangerous to the aircraft.</p>
<h3 id="fire-test-button-1"><a class="header" href="#fire-test-button-1">Fire Test Button</a></h3>
<p>When pressed, this button tests for functionality of the FIRE and OVRHT lamps.

detection and continuity performance of the fire and overhead warning systems.
Holding the Warning Lights Test switch in the WARN TEST position, then
simultaneously pressing and releasing the Fire Test Button performs the test.
Proper system function is confirmed with the four FIRE and OVRHT lamps off while
the Fire Test Button is pressed, then illuminating when it is released.</p>
<h2 id="ejection-seats"><a class="header" href="#ejection-seats">Ejection Seats</a></h2>
<p><img src="systems/../img/ext_ejection.jpg" alt="ext_view_ejection_seat" /></p>
<p>The Phantom II uses the Martin Baker Mk. H-7 ejection seat in both positions for
safe aircrew extraction in the event of airframe loss. Triggering ejection using
the face curtain or lower ejection handles fires the seat mounted initiator that
jettisons the canopy. Once the canopy is clear of the airframe, the ejection gun
primary charge fires, unlatching the seat from the cockpit and initiating seat
climb-out. As the seat rises, restraints on the legs pull them back for clearance
and the drogue timer is set. At the appropriate height, a lanyard attaching the
rocket motor initiator to the airframe trips the firing pin for the main rocket
engine to clear the aircraft. The previously set drogue gun fires at this time,
deploying a pair of small chutes to stabilize the seat in attitude and initiate
deceleration.</p>
<p>Once the seat has reached a pre-set barometric altitude between 11,500 and
14,500 feet, or momentarily after stabilization if lower, scissor mechanisms
release the crew-member with the survival kit-containing seat pan from the
ejection frame and deploys the main chute. In the event of ejection below the
barostat altitude, the WSO chute is fully deployed at 5 seconds after ejection
initiation, and the pilot one second later.</p>
<h3 id="eject-light"><a class="header" href="#eject-light">Eject Light</a></h3>
<p><img src="systems/../img/wso_eject_light.jpg" alt="wso_eject_light" /></p>
<p>In the event of loss of intercom power, the pilot can warn the WSO to prepare
for ejection by pressing the EJECT switch found on the left canopy sill forward
of the flap switch. This illuminates a pair of warning lamps found on the rear
cockpit indicator panel. This can also be done by the Pilot to warn the WSO of an ejection.</p>

the rear seat - both seats, or the rear seat only. The handle is marked PLT EJECT
PULL TURN. When the handle is oriented vertically, single seat ejection is
selected; to set dual seat ejection, the handle is rotated clockwise to the

<p>Found on the front left cockpit sub-panel, the External Stores Emergency
Release, also known as the panic button, will release all air to ground
munitions, external tanks, and any pods subject to jettison. Sparrow and
Sidewinder missiles, along with all pylons, will remain in place. Pushing the
button will show the yellow paint inside its recess to confirm its actuation.
Performing the actuation disengages external fuel tank transfer automatically,
permitting proper flow of internal wing tanks without further pilot action. The

<p>In general, stations 3, 4, 6 and 7 can be used to load Air-To-Air Missiles, or
also Jammer and Targeting Pods.</p>
<p>Air-To-Ground Ordnance is mostly carrier on pylons 1, 2, 5, 8 and 9.</p>
<p>Pylons 2 and 8 are special, since they can be equipped with the
Special-Weapons-Adapter (SWA) and have additional attach-points on their sides
(labelled 2L, 2R, 8L, 8R) for loading AIM-9 Sidewinder missiles without
occupying the entire pylon.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 AIM-9 Sidewinder can be loaded onto pylon 2 and 8 additionally to other
ordnance. Hence, it is still possible to equip for example a Maverick on the
same pylon.</p>

<h2 id="internal-cannon-m61a1-vulcan"><a class="header" href="#internal-cannon-m61a1-vulcan">Internal Cannon M61A1 Vulcan</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/m61.jpg" alt="m61" /></p>
<p>The General Electric M61 Vulcan cannon finally went to war as an integral part
of the Phantom with the advent of the F-4E, with the nose profile and APQ-120
modified to fit the weapon. Carrying 639 rounds in the internal drum, the
six-barreled Gatling style rotary cannon provides a user-selectable rate of fire
from 4000 to 6000 rounds per minute, delivering a muzzle velocity in excess of
3,450 ft/s, with armor piercing incendiary and high explosive incendiary round
options available. Useful in both air-to-air and air to ground roles, the Vulcan
was used for four confirmed kills by the USAF over Vietnam with the F-4E.</p>
<p>To utilize the M61,
the <a href="https://heatblur-simulations.github.io/f-4e-manual/cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#station-select-buttons">GUN station select switch</a>
must be selected, the <a href="https://heatblur-simulations.github.io/f-4e-manual/cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master
Arm</a>
must be ON, and
the <a href="https://heatblur-simulations.github.io/f-4e-manual/cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#head-up-display-indicators">Gun selection</a>
on the Pinky Switch (Aft) must be actuated. This will illuminate the GUN lamp on the Head Up
Display.</p>
<p>For air-to-air usage,
the <a href="https://heatblur-simulations.github.io/f-4e-manual/cockpit/pilot/dcsg_controls.html#sight-mode-knob">optical sight</a>
should be selected to A/A mode. In air-to-air mode, the optical sight functions as a lead computing
optical sighting (LCOS), thus maneuvering in both elevation and azimuth relative to a radar
locked target, or a default 1000' range setting in the event of no lock. With a
lock, the range bar presentation is relative to 6700' just to the left of the
tick at the 1 o-clock position, down to 1000' at the 6 o-clock position.</p>
<p>For air to ground use,
the <a href="https://heatblur-simulations.github.io/f-4e-manual/cockpit/pilot/dcsg_controls.html#sight-mode-knob">optical sight</a>
should be selected to A/G mode, the
<a href="https://heatblur-simulations.github.io/f-4e-manual/cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#delivery-mode-knob">Delivery Mode knob</a>
should be set in the OFF or Direct mode, and the desired
<a href="https://heatblur-simulations.github.io/f-4e-manual/cockpit/pilot/dcsg_controls.html#reticle-depression-knob">sight depression mil setting</a>
be entered for the intended attack profile.
Depression is set relative from the Fuselage Reference Line (FRL). While
Depression will lower the reticle in elevation, there is no azimuth drift due to
relative aircraft motion.</p>
<p>Gun rate is controlled with
the <a href="https://heatblur-simulations.github.io/f-4e-manual/cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.html#rate-of-fire-switch">Rate switch</a>
on the Pedestal panel, and is
selectable as High (6000 rounds per minute) or Low (4000 rounds per minute).
Also on the Pedestal panel is
the <a href="https://heatblur-simulations.github.io/f-4e-manual/cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.html#rounds-remaining-indicator">gun rounds remaining indicator</a>.</p>
<p>Of note is
the <a href="https://heatblur-simulations.github.io/f-4e-manual/cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.html#auto-clear-switch">Auto Clear</a>
function; the cannon will fire approximately between 5
and 11 rounds from the point the pilot has released the trigger to clear all
bolt actions in the cannon; this spin-down takes approximately one second, and
the gun cannot be fired again during this operation. While the Pedestal panel
carries the Auto Clear switch, this switch does not have any control over the
internal M61A1 cannon, and can only deactivate round clearance for podded
external cannon installations.</p>
<p><img src="stores/../img/ext_gun_and_purge_door.jpg" alt="ext_gun_door_open" /></p>
<h2 id="external-cannon-pods-suu-16a-and-suu-23a"><a class="header" href="#external-cannon-pods-suu-16a-and-suu-23a">External Cannon Pods SUU-16/A and SUU-23/A</a></h2>
<p><img src="stores/../img/suupods.jpg" alt="SUU pods" /></p>
<p>Built to both provide gun capability to aircraft that did not mount them
internally, and to increase available direct fire in the close air support
mission, the SUU-16/A and SUU-23/A gun pods were both built around the M61A1 and
a 1200 round ammunition load. Both pods are fixed-rate at 6000 rounds per
minute, and up to three can be concurrently installed and driven by the fire
control system; while up to five can be loaded for ferry purposes, and
promotional images have shown such a configuration, only three can be activated.</p>
<p>The primary difference between the -16/A and -23/A pods are their method of
power; the former using a ram air turbine arrangement to drive its motor, while
the latter is internally powered. This difference had an effect on relative
utility - while the -23/A could be fired at any airspeed, thus allowing it to be
loaded onto slower aircraft, the -16/A's ram air turbine required a minimum
speed of 300 knots to fire, and only reached its optimum performance above 400
knots. Both pods have an auto-clear function for safety, which cause rounds
loaded in the breeches to be released back into the ammo bin, which does entail
a momentary delay of one to two seconds prior to being able to fire the pod
again.</p>
<p>Activation of the SUU pods are performed by selecting their respective <a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#station-select-buttons">Station
Select buttons</a>,
and placing the <a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#delivery-mode-knob">Delivery Mode knob</a>
in OFF or
Direct. <a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#weapon-selector-knob">The Weapon Selector knob</a>
can be in any position other than TV or ARM, unless CAGE mode is
activated. The desired <a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.html#auto-clear-switch">Auto Clear setting</a>
should be selected, and <a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm</a>
set to ON to activate the pod. On the SUU-16, the Master Arm activation deploys the
ram air turbine.</p>
<p>Installed, the guns are boresight along the Fuselage Reference Line. Thus,
with the <a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/dcsg_controls.html#sight-mode-knob">optical sight</a>
in air to air mode, the rounds will fall in accordance
with reticle center, just as the main cannon- only with the natural offset of
their respective pylon position, thus allowing for effective natural gunnery, if
only affected by a moderate increase in resulting CEP. In the same fashion, in
air to ground mode, the SUU pods observe the same performance relative to the
reticle depression schedule as the internal cannon, again, with their respective
offsets from centerline and CEP increase.</p>
<p>To safe the gun pods after combat, prior to deactivating <a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master
Arm</a>,
the <a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/pedestal_group.html#auto-clear-switch">Auto Clear</a>
switch should be placed into the Auto Clear position, the trigger squeezed
momentarily, and the respective <a href="stores/../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#station-select-buttons">Station
Select buttons</a>
pushed to off. On the SUU-16, this will close the ram air turbine.</p>

<p>The F-4E Phantom II stands as an enduring testament to aerial supremacy, owing much of its
reputation to its formidable air-to-air capabilities.</p>
<p>The <a href="stores/air_to_air/./aim_7.html">AIM-7 Sparrow missile</a> takes center stage in the Phantom II's air-to-air
capabilities. Comprising a substantial portion of the F-4E's air-to-air armament,
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/./aim_7.html">Sparrow's</a> radar-guided system allows pilots to engage adversaries before they
enter the visual horizon.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/real_life_aim_7_hawaii.jpeg" alt="real_life_aim_7" /></p>
<p>In close-quarters engagements, the F-4E relies on the <a href="stores/air_to_air/./aim_9.html">AIM-9 Sidewinder,</a> a short-range,
infrared-guided missile celebrated for its agility and responsiveness. Constituting a vital
component of the Phantom II's air-to-air weaponry, the Sidewinder excels in the intense and dynamic
scenarios of dogfights.</p>

<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/aim7.jpg" alt="aim7" /></p>
<p>The AIM-7 is a semi active radar missile with a maximum launch range of approx. 26 nautical miles.</p>
<p>Originally designated the AAM-N-6 Sparrow III, the AIM-7 Sparrow saw initial
service entry with the United States Navy in 1958. Unlike the beam-riding AIM-7A
(AAM-N-2 Sparrow I), which required the launching aircraft to maintain boresight
on the target for the flyout of the weapon, the semi-active radar homing AIM-7C
could effectively engage a maneuvering target well off boresight, so long as the
designating aircraft's radar could maintain a lock during the missile's
intercept. The AIM-7C quickly gave way to the 7D, which saw a number of kills
over Vietnam, and the 7E, which scored the majority of the type's kills in
Southeast Asia. Additionally, the F-4E saw compatibility with the AIM-7F and
AIM-7M.</p>
<p>Utilization of the AIM-7 begins with tuning the onboard rounds, performed with
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#radar-missile-power-switch">RDR MSL switch</a>
, selecting it into the CW ON position. This tuning process
takes approximately one minute, and can be initiated once power has been applied
for at least one minute to the radar (any position out of OFF) in most operating
environments (ambient temperature below 90 degrees F). The missiles are properly
tuned when
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#missile-status-lights">missile status light</a>
(RDR) is illuminated in each station carrying
a Sparrow missile for at least one minute. After successful tuning,
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#radar-missile-power-switch">RDR MSL switch</a>
can be returned to the STBY (Standby) position. The status lamps will
turn off once returned to STBY. Once in the combat area,
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#radar-missile-power-switch">RDR MSL switch</a>
should be returned to the CW ON position, to maintain proper missile
tuning state during the engagement.</p>
<p>To employ an AIM-7,
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/dcsg_controls.html#sight-mode-knob">optical sight</a>
should be placed into the A/A position,
which stabilizes the Reticle at the Radar Boresight Line in the window. The roll
tabs function to provide the pilot with relative roll attitude guidance in
instrument conditions (weather or nighttime), and the right side of the 50 mil
diameter circle (outer) functions as a range bar when a radar lock is achieved
against a target, displaying ranges up to 20,000' (top) to 3000' (bottom), with
12,000' signified at the 3 o-clock position.</p>
<p>When radar lock against a target is achieved with AIM-7 selected, a pair of
strobes surround the locked target in azimuth. Identified as Rmax and Rmax 2,
they represent effective ranges against a 1 G target (Rmax), and a high rate
maneuvering target based on altitude (Rmax 2, representing 8G up to 20k, 6G to
35k, and 4G above 35,000'). When a missile is launched, the Rmax 2 strobe falls
to the bottom of the display, and begins driving upwards towards the target
lock; this functions as a missile flyout timer. When the timer reaches the
locked target, it can be assumed the missile has arrived. The display does not
provide Rmin, but instead reverts to a break X warning superimposed over the
radar image should Rmin be attained for a Sparrow launch.</p>
<p>Prior to engagement, a determination must be made as to whether or not the
missile <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#interlock-switch">interlocks</a>
will be kept in, or positioned out. The interlocks preclude
an AIM-7 shot when outside of effective firing parameters, those being the
missile in range (illuminating
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/dcsg_controls.html#in-range-light">IN RANGE light</a>),
the target aim dot within
the ASE (Allowable Steering Error) circle on the radar display, and the radar
display mode out of VI (Vis-Ident mode).</p>
<p>With the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#interlock-switch">interlocks</a>
in, should any of the three aforementioned restrictions be
met - target out of range, aim dot outside the ASE, or the radar left in VI, a
trigger actuation will not cause the release of a missile.
With <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#interlock-switch">interlocks</a>
out, an AIM-7 will be released no matter the condition of the three interlocks.</p>
<p>When parameters are met,
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/overhead_indicators.html#shoot-lights">SHOOT lamps</a>
will illuminate. Found in both
cockpits, these lights reinforce the condition of good launch conditions for the
AIM-7. In the event a target enters a main beam clutter situation (aspect angle
between 81 and 99 degrees and lower than 5 degrees above the horizon), the
lights will turn off, even though the interlock requirements are met. Maneuver
should be utilized to bring the target outside this region prior to launch.</p>
<p>At the point of engagement, AIM-7 missiles are selected using the Pinky Switch
on the outboard (left) throttle arm, selecting the forward position. This
illuminates the RADAR lamp on
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#head-up-display-indicators">Head Up Display panel</a>.</p>
<p>Before employing the AIM-7E Sparrow, a delay of four seconds should be given if
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm switch</a>
is set in the ON position prior to radar lock on, or a
delay of two seconds if
the <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm switch</a>
is set to ON after radar lock on.
This is due to the set-in period of the missile speed-gate. With the AIM-7F, this
delay is reduced to two seconds
with <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm switch</a>
On prior to lock, or immediately
after selecting <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#master-arm-switch">Master Arm switch</a>
to On if lock on was achieved first. Should these
delays not be adhered to, the missile may fail to track because of improper
target doppler injection.</p>
<p>With the target in parameters
or <a href="stores/air_to_air/../../cockpit/pilot/weapon_management.html#interlock-switch">interlocks</a>
out, pressing the trigger fires off
an AIM-7. A second AIM-7 can be fired immediately at the same target, if
desired, by releasing, then squeezing the trigger a second time- holding it on
the second actuation.</p>

</div><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="aim-9-sidewinder"><a class="header" href="#aim-9-sidewinder">AIM-9 Sidewinder</a></h1>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_air/../../img/aim9.jpg" alt="aim9" /></p>
<p>Entering service with the United States Navy in 1956, and finally accepted by
the United States Air Force in 1964, the short range, infrared seeking AIM-9
Sidewinder is considered by most to be the world's first truly effective air to
air guided missile. Beginning with the AIM-9B and maintaining compatibility to
the AIM-9M in US service, the Sidewinder provided the Phantom II with a capable
close-in weapon system against rapidly maneuvering opponents.</p>
<p>Employment of the AIM-9 can be performed with or without a radar lock, and is
initiated by selecting Master Arm to ON and selecting the Throttle Pinky Switch
to the center position for Heat. The HEAT lamp on the Head Up Display will
illuminate, and available AIM-9 missiles will illuminate on the Missile Status
Panel. The Optical Sight should be selected to A/A, and the reticle will
stabilize at the Radar Boresight Line, which is the boresight location for the
Sidewinders on the rails.</p>
<p>Should a radar lock be achieved, the sight will display the range bar on the
right side as previously described, with 20,000' indicated at the top, and
3,000' range indicated at the bottom. With a radar lock on, the radar will
display a pair of strobes signifying Rmax and Rmin for the Sidewinder against
the target under current launch conditions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 The AIM-9 does not receive a guidance handoff from
the APQ-120 like on later aircraft to direct the seeker's look angle. Instead,
the ASE circle presents the aim dot against the target to bring it to the RBL.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Centering the aim dot in the ASE aligns the target to the RBL, thus allowing for
rapid acquisition by the seeker of the selected AIM-9. Once the missile's tone
changes to signify lock, the pilot can then select the AAR button on the grip to
allow for Sidewinder self-track (seeker uncage); this function allows the seeker
to maintain acquisition of the target (noted by the shifted audio tone), while
permitting maneuver of the aircraft to a better aspect angle or range solution
prior to launch if the situation allows. The amount of maneuver available to a
given Sidewinder type is based on the variant, and should be considered before
making the selection.</p>

<p>The F-4E Phantom II's air-to-ground capabilities are marked by a commitment to precision and
versatility. Armed with a diverse array of munitions, ranging from
traditional <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/conventional_bombs.html">unguided bombs</a> to
sophisticated <a href="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/overview.html">precision-guided missiles</a>, the Phantom II is equipped to
undertake a variety of ground attack missions.</p>
<p>Integral to the F-4E's air-to-ground arsenal are guided munitions used for precision strike.
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/laser_guided_bombs.html">Laser-guided bombs (LGBs)</a> and other precision-guided munitions enable

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="missiles"><a class="header" href="#missiles">Missiles</a></h1>
<p>Among the Phantom II's lethal armament are the AGM-65 Maverick and AGM-45 Shrike missiles, each
playing a distinct role in the aircraft's capacity to engage ground targets and neutralize enemy
threats.</p>
<p>The <a href="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/maverick.html">AGM-65 Maverick</a>, a precision-guided air-to-ground missile, uses its versatile
guidance systems, including electro-optical and infrared seekers, to allow pilots to engage a
variety of ground-based threats.</p>
<p>The <a href="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/shrike.html">AGM-45 Shrike</a> missile takes on a specialized role in Suppression of Enemy Air
Defenses (SEAD). Designed to seek out and neutralize enemy radar installations, the Shrike is an
anti-radiation missile that targets radar-emitting threats.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="agm-45-shrike-anti-radiation-missile"><a class="header" href="#agm-45-shrike-anti-radiation-missile">AGM-45 Shrike Anti-Radiation Missile</a></h1>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/../../../img/agm45.jpg" alt="agm45" /></p>
<p>The Sparrow-derived AGM-45 Shrike is an early attempt at an anti-radiation
missile for the suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) role. Mating a
frequency-tuned seeker with the rocket body of an AIM-7, the Shrike provided the
United States Navy, and later the United States Air Force, with a standoff
option for the engagement of enemy SAM radars. While nominally effective, in
practice the Shrike was a difficult weapon to employ properly, given its limited
range, low speed, and primary engagement mode that left the launching aircraft
within lethal envelopes of most opposing air defense systems. Further reducing
its potency was a small warhead, meaning that in most instances only the
emitting antenna itself was damaged, rather than the vehicle it was mounted to.</p>
<p>While limited in most respects, the Shrike received a number of upgrades over
its lifetime, lasting in service from the mid-60s in Vietnam, until just after
the Gulf War, through better engines and additional seeker updates for later SAM
systems. The Shrike was put into use by two foreign users - the Israeli Air
Force, who also modified it for a ground-launched version, and through
clandestine means with the RAF during the Falklands War.</p>
<h2 id="variants-2"><a class="header" href="#variants-2">Variants</a></h2>
<p>Only the A variant can be equipped on this version of the Phantom.</p>
<h2 id="employment"><a class="header" href="#employment">Employment</a></h2>
<p>The AGM-45 has three separate launch modes available: AGM-45 (WRCS), LOFT, and
DIRECT.</p>
<h3 id="agm-45-wrcs-mode"><a class="header" href="#agm-45-wrcs-mode">AGM-45 (WRCS Mode)</a></h3>
<p>Used only with the AGM-45 in conjunction with the WRCS, this mode is the primary
means of employment of the Shrike. The mode is based around a high altitude
attack profile, and depends on the pre-programmed weapon engagement envelope of
the AGM-45 stored within the WRCS. This profile, in conjunction with current
aircraft state information from the INS and a signal provided by the receiver in
the missile - having detecting an emitter of the type its attuned to, define a
flight path and release envelope for optimum probability of the missile reaching
the target.</p>
<p>With the WRCS mode selected to AGM-45, the run is initiated by arming a station
select button for a hardpoint carrying an AGM-45 missile. Doing so activates the
missile's receiver, and upon emitter acquisition will provide the aforementioned
information signal to the WRCS. The WSO should enter a target altitude value
into the computer control panel, if necessary, using a mean value for the
current target area, and if multiple missiles are to be launched, a release
advance time setting. The WRCS receives both data from the missile regarding
look angle from the missile, along with corrected look angle from the INS; the
selection for which data to use is performed with the DF REJ switch, and should
in most all cases be left said position.</p>
<p>Look angle and estimated range available, the WRCS will provide guidance
instruction using the needles on the ADI. Once oriented in the dive angle, the
horizontal range to target will be provided on the HSI and BDHI, so long as the
INS position is selected for navigation mode.</p>
<p>When the aircraft's orientation is correct and the ADI needles are centered,
once the aircraft is within missile range, one of the indexer lights will
illuminate based on the detected range to target to instruct the pilot as to the
required release maneuver- dive, level, or pull-up. At this time, the pilot can
press and hold the bomb release button to initiate the attack. Once the release
range is attained in the instructed profile, the missile will be launched.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Special note must be made of the importance of maintaining the ADI needles
centered, especially the vertical azimuth relationship. Because the orientation
of the missile itself when installed on the wing can cause offset of its
receiver to occur when the aircraft is banked, preparation of the attack may
require repeated adjustments with wings brought to level every few seconds to
make certain the aircraft is pointing at the emitter.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="pull-up"><a class="header" href="#pull-up">Pull-Up</a></h4>
<p>The Pull-Up instruction is guidance for the pilot to initiate a steady rotation
back to the horizon, and, if desired, continue into a steady climb state until
range requirements are met and the missile is launched. The pilot can choose to
either bring the aircraft to near level and stop, or pull further into a low
climb profile. When the aircraft is approximately 5 seconds away from release,
the level indicator will illuminate, directing the pilot to maintain the current
orientation until the Shrike is away.</p>
<h4 id="level"><a class="header" href="#level">Level</a></h4>
<p>The level instruction is less of a directive than a confirmation of impending
launch. Depending on the initial attack setup, the level signal may immediately
occur, or occur quite soon after one of the other two instructions. From that
point, it is simply required that the pilot maintain the current state for best
chance of missile success.</p>
<h4 id="dive"><a class="header" href="#dive">Dive</a></h4>
<p>The dive command in the WRCS mode occurs only when the attack is initiated very
close to the target. The situation and proximity to the SAM installation must be
considered prior to attack commitment with the pickle button, as any response by
the battery has a high probability of arriving before the missile can
potentially kill the emitter. The dive command, once followed, will then be
followed with the level indicator once missile launch imminent.</p>
<h3 id="loft"><a class="header" href="#loft">Loft</a></h3>
<p>The Loft attack profile of the Shrike is like a loft bombing attack, utilizing
the weapon lookup tables to define a suitable IP to release distance, the
necessary release angle, and the time from IP to pull-up is determined by the
lookup table speed versus the IP to release distance.</p>
<p>One key difference in the Loft mode versus the WRCS employment modes for the
Shrike is the primary usage of the NORM mode rather than DF REJ; this places the
missile's receiver in the role of the azimuth guidance directive on the ADI
rather than the INS. The ADI's vertical needle will appear when the AGM-45
position is selected on the pedestal switch.</p>
<p>The attack is performed like a loft bombing profile; the Phantom is flown over
the IP at the intended altitude and airspeed, with the bomb release button being
held from the point of flyover. The countdown timer initiates, the horizontal
ADI bar appears to maintain level flight, and the pull-up lamp illuminates. When
the pull-up timer runs out, the pull-up lamp will turn off, the sight reticle will
turn off, and the horizontal ADI bar will move to display G load as normal for
the pull-up maneuver; a correct profile will keep both ADI bars centered. When
the aircraft achieves the programmed release angle, the missile will launch.
Once launch has occurred, the pull-up lamp and sight reticle will illuminate
again, and the horizontal ADI bar will stow.</p>
<h3 id="direct-mode"><a class="header" href="#direct-mode">Direct Mode</a></h3>
<p>Direct mode employment of the AGM-45 is dependent on the crew knowing the
precise location of the target SAM emitter; while it can be utilized as a
fallback method in event of a WRCS system failure, the need for at least 10
degrees of dive angle against the targe for successful delivery places a premium
on being able to plan the attack against a specific point on the ground.</p>
<p>To employ the weapon in Direct mode, the crew confirms receipt of emitter audio,
and initiates a dive to center the ADI needles at the target. The crew should
then check the dive chart for angle and AGL, and the pilot should maneuver into
that orientation, maintaining a centered vertical ADI needle. From that point,
the bomb release button is pressed and held until the Shrike is fired.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="agm-65-maverick"><a class="header" href="#agm-65-maverick">AGM-65 Maverick</a></h1>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/missiles/../../../img/agm65.jpg" alt="agm65" /></p>
<p>Entering service in 1972, the AGM-65 air to surface missile provided the Phantom
II with a direct-fire long range weapon, capable of destroying armor, mechanized
infantry, and other targets with electro-optical, and later - infrared imaged,
accuracy.</p>
<p>The F-4E was capable of carrying up to six between the two inboard
wing pylons. The AGM-65 Maverick has an approximate maximum range of 12 nautical miles.</p>
<p>Employment of the Maverick is shared between both cockpits, with the pilot
responsible for stores and mode selection, and initial seeker placement. From
the point the seeker head is stabilized on the intended target area, either crew
member can direct the final intended contrast target.</p>
<h2 id="variants-3"><a class="header" href="#variants-3">Variants</a></h2>
<p>Available variants include:</p>
<div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Variant</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>A</td><td>TV-Guided</td></tr>
<tr><td>B</td><td>TV-Guided with a narrower FOV than A</td></tr>
<tr><td>D</td><td>IR-Guided</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<h2 id="employment-1"><a class="header" href="#employment-1">Employment</a></h2>
<p>To utilize a Maverick of any variant, the pilot begins by pressing the
applicable Station Select buttons, and setting Master Arm to On. The pilot then
must select Direct on the Delivery Mode Knob, and the TV position on the Weapon
Select Knob.</p>
<p>When selected to TV, the 3-minute missile gyro warmup sequence initiates; it is
suggested to start the stopwatch to the left of the Multiple Weapon Panel as a
means to avoid disturbing this sequence. Once the warmup has completed, the
lower amber ARM indicators on the Station Select buttons will illuminate.
Failure to permit this gyro cycle can potentially damage the guidance unit of
the missiles aboard. During this warmup period, it is necessary to set the
optical sight to A/G mode, and enter a depression of 45 mils, so that the sight
alignment be that of the missile seeker.</p>
<p>Once the warmup has completed, the crew may activate their displays for viewing
seeker video; the pilot selects the TV position on the Scope Display Select
switch on the Pedestal panel, and the WSO places the radar display mode knob to
TV and the Video Select Switch to WEAPON instead of ASQ.</p>
<p>With the displays activated, the pilot maneuvers the aircraft to position the
sight reticle over the target area, and either crew member can then press their
respective flight stick trigger to initiate video. With video active, command of
the missile seeker is controlled by the crew member who activated the video
signal, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="pilot"><a class="header" href="#pilot">Pilot</a></h3>
<p>With the pipper over the target area, pressing and holding the AAR button
enables track slewing with the Forward Hand Control stick inboard from the
throttle. Once the seeker crosshair is over the intended target, releasing the
AAR button performs a lock-on of the missile to the contrast area under the
crosshair. If the missile seeker fails to achieve lock on the correct target,
the lock can be broken by squeezing the trigger again, bringing the missile
seeker back to its boresight position, and then reattempting the lock with the
AAR button. Should the target not appear to have enough contrast versus the
surrounding background, the contrast can be swapped from black hot to white-hot,
or vice versa, using the Target Contrast Switch on the Pedestal panel. Leaving
the switch in the Auto position allows the seeker to attempt to determine the
best option for contrast.</p>
<p>Should a missile appear to not be functioning correctly, it can be rejected to
the next round in the release sequence using the TGT/MSL REJ switch.</p>
<p>Once lock on the correct target is attained, the missile is launched using the
bomb button. To initiate lock on of the next target, the process is started over
with the squeezing of the trigger.</p>
<p>With the above in mind for the electro-optical AGM-65A and B, the AGM-65D has a
few minor alterations to the procedure. The seeker of the 65D has two FOV
settings, wide and narrow, and initial video signal is provided in the wide
setting. In this setting, a quartet of L shaped brackets define the region of
the display that will be zoomed in upon selecting the narrow field of view.
Pressing the trigger a second time changes the video to the narrow setting,
allowing for a more precise selection of the target.</p>
<h3 id="wso"><a class="header" href="#wso">WSO</a></h3>
<p>The WSO performs the same sequence of actions for the seeker guidance, and can
initiate video upon pilot confirmation of pipper location using the trigger of
his own flight stick in the rear cockpit. From this point, the WSO uses the
radar's cursor control stick to manage the seeker head placement, lock, and in
the case of AGM-65D employment FoV controls. Rather than pressing and holding
the AAR button to activate slew, the WSO selects the half-action trigger
position, and then slews the seeker using the cursor control.</p>
<p>Once the applicable target is under the crosshair, lock is achieved using the
full action command. Should the WSO need to change 65D FoV to narrow, a
subsequent press of half action will do so. The WSO can change the contrast mode
with the Contrast Switch on the left side console next to the radar display
panel. And, once lock is achieved, the WSO can fire the missile using the
Missile Launch button found on his flight stick - in the same position as the

<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/../../img/lau3.jpg" alt="lau3" /></p>
<p>Also known as the Mighty Mouse, the Mk 4 series of unguided aerial rockets
originated as an air-to-air weapon. Given the rocket's undirected nature,
tendency for wide dispersion in salvo usage, and overall poor performance in its
intended role - most notably an incident in which over 200 rounds were fired by a
pair of F-89 Scorpions in a failed attempt to down an un-commanded target drone,
the Mighty Mouse was wholly unfit for purpose. However, the rocket's peculiar
traits were ingeniously capitalized upon by transitioning it to the role of an
air to ground area effect weapon.</p>
<p>Having become a useful tool, the original Mk 4's capability was expanded upon
with a wide array of warheads, including smoke, anti-personnel flechette, and
those used by the USAF on the Phantom - the M156 White Phosphorous, Mk 1 High
Explosive, and the Mk 5 High Explosive Anti Tank. Depending on the hardpoint
location and configuration, up to 3 LAU-3 pod launchers can be installed per
hardpoint, each carrying 19 FFARs.</p>

<p>The F-4E Phantom II was equipped with TV-guided bombs, notably the GBU-8 and AGM-62 Walleye,
enhancing its precision strike capabilities. The GBU-8, also known as the &quot;HOBOS&quot; (Homing Bomb
System), was a laser-guided bomb developed for the F-4E Phantom II. It featured a semi-active laser
seeker that required external laser designation from the launching aircraft or a designated
third-party source. This bomb significantly improved the F-4E's accuracy in hitting designated
targets, especially those with pinpoint precision requirements. he AGM-62 Walleye was an
electro-optical, TV-guided glide bomb employed by the F-4E. This precision-guided munition had a
television camera in its nose, allowing the pilot to visually guide the bomb to its target by
watching a live video feed. The Walleye increased the F-4E's effectiveness in attacking
well-defended and high-value targets, as it provided a &quot;man-in-the-loop&quot; guidance system.</p>
<p>Both the GBU-8 and AGM-62 Walleye were crucial additions to the F-4E's arsenal, enhancing its
ability to conduct precise strikes with reduced collateral damage. These TV-guided bombs showcased
the adaptability of the F-4E Phantom II in integrating advanced munitions to meet evolving mission

<p>The Phantom has a wide range of weapon modes to employ bombs. Most modes will need the WSO to make
inputs into the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/arbcs.html">ARBCS</a>/<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS.</a>.</p>
<p>For assistance in calculation
see <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../dcs/bombing_computer.html">Bombing Calculator Chapter</a>. You can open and close it by
pressing <kbd>RCTRL</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> in game.</p>
<h2 id="loft-1"><a class="header" href="#loft-1">LOFT</a></h2>
<p>Loft bombing is utilized to deliver multiple bombs with minimum exposure to
ground fire and no target flyover. As the name entails, the aircraft transitions
from a low altitude to a higher one in a pull-up, thus lofting the released
munitions at a pre-calculated point that reaches the target.</p>
<p>Planning for a loft attack requires a known target location, so that distances
for the IP and respective bomb ranges can be calculated. The ballistics tables
are references to determine delivery pattern and pull-up-to-target range. With
this information, the number of bombs can be decided, which determines the
spread, and knowing the pull-up to target range - the pull-up point distance to the
IP can be chosen. As the path from IP to pull-up is flown at a constant speed,
this can then be used to determined time from said distance for pull-up Timer
entry. And with the ballistic table reference for the LOW angle, the profile is
set.</p>
<p>Upon entry to the target area, the pilot flies the intended course to the IP,
and once over, presses and holds the bomb release button to initiate the run.
Flying direct or crabbed to the pull-up point, the pilot maintains the bomb
release button in the down position, and holds it until the desired munitions
have released.</p>
<p>In LOFT mode, the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/arbcs.html">ARBCS</a> programs for a 4.0 G pull-up
schedule, and will automatically release the selected munitions once the bombing run is initiated,
timer runout has occurred, and pre-set LOW pitch (gyro) angle is achieved. At the initiation of the
bomb run, upon pressing the bomb button, the ARBCS
overrides any other navigational guidance provided on
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a> and assumes
command of the pointers to show deviation relative to the programmed attack
profile. The vertical pointer offsets in the direction requiring yaw input to
maintain target alignment. On approach to the loft point, the horizontal needle
shows deviation from a 1.0 G flight path. When the pull-up timer completes
signaling the 4.0 G pull-up, deviation of the horizontal needle is relative to
the desired constant 4.0 G pull, with the initial drift representing achieving
4.0 G of load in two seconds. Maintaining the horizontal needle centered means
the pilot has increased and held G at the proper rate for maximum accuracy.
Control of the ADI by
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/arbcs.html">AN/AJB-7</a> is maintained until the pilot releases the
bomb button after the last desired munition is released.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../img/loft.jpg" alt="loft" /></p>
<h2 id="timed-over-the-shoulder---timed-os"><a class="header" href="#timed-over-the-shoulder---timed-os">Timed Over the Shoulder - (TIMED) O/S</a></h2>
<p>Derived from the Loft mode, Timed Over the Shoulder bombing is available for
circumstances in which a direct target flyover is possible, originating from a
known IP position, with the attack flown at a known altitude and airspeed
determined during mission planning. Setup of the LABS system requires time
(calculated using the known distance from the set IP to the target flyover point
and the intended airspeed) and calculated release angle for the resulting
airspeed and munition, which is entered into the High Angle setting; this value
must be in excess of 90 degrees, and the Low Angle and secondary timer settings
can be left at any value. Flying the appropriate heading at the correct speed
guarantees target flyover, and upon timer runout an audible tone will be heard
to initiate pull-up, along with the Pull-Up Lamp illuminating. This timing action
is initiated by pressing the bomb button over the IP, and holding it throughout
the attack run.</p>
<p>Like Loft mode, the pull-up signal indications will also trigger the horizontal
and vertical pointers on
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a> to display
appropriate pitch and angle indications to maintain proper aircraft orientation for accurate release
point entry, and the target pull rate is 4.0G The guidance drives the attacking aircraft through an
Immelmann, and the bombs will release at the entered High Angle value. Maximum accuracy is achieved
through maintaining a centered horizontal needle during the entire bombing run, and like Loft,
the ADI reverts back to the previous function once the bomb button is released after the last
intended munition for the run has been dropped.</p>
<h2 id="instantaneous-over-the-shoulder---inst-os"><a class="header" href="#instantaneous-over-the-shoulder---inst-os">Instantaneous Over the Shoulder - INST O/S</a></h2>
<p>Further, derived from the Timed O/S mode, Instantaneous Over the Shoulder bombing
provides the same combined attack/escape profile as the former against targets
of opportunity. It does this by dispensing with the need for an IP location and
the resulting time, and simply requires entry of a High Angle value in excess of
90 degrees pitch. Once the aircraft is directly over the target, the pilot
presses and holds the bomb release button and initiates the 4.0 G wings level
pull up into the Immelmann maneuver. The LABS computer performs the
same <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>
display overrides as Loft and Timed O/S, placing the horizontal director needle
at the pitch appropriate for a 4.0 G pull, and the vertical director displays
deviation to maintain proper angle of bank through the maneuver. Upon reaching
the necessary angle of pitch, the munitions separation begins, and the bomb
release button can be released once all desired rounds have been ejected from
the aircraft, thus resetting the display of
the ADI.</p>
<h2 id="timed-low-angle-drogue-delivery---t-ladd"><a class="header" href="#timed-low-angle-drogue-delivery---t-ladd">Timed Low Angle Drogue Delivery - T LAD(D)</a></h2>
<p>Conceived as a delivery method for tactical nuclear bombs, Timed Low Angle
Drogue Delivery is performed just like it sounds. The mode performs a low
altitude ingress, transitioning through a 3.5 G pull-up into a 45 degree climb
profile that allows for a lofted release of a weapon at the top of the climb,
allowing an escape attempt as the munition's deployed drogue slows the decent to
the target. While originally designed with nuclear intent, the method provides
yet another option for accurate bomb delivery with a high, or high to low,
escape option for appropriate targets.</p>
<p>Planning of the T LADD engagement begins in the bombing tables, determining the
correct entry altitude and airspeed for the selected weapon, as well as the
resulting altitude gain and time from pull up initiation to release - which will
be used as the Release control timer value, as well as the distance downrange
this climb maneuver will take the aircraft. Using this range as a baseline, an
appropriate approach angle is determined, and a suitable IP waypoint is chosen.
The distance between the IP and the pull-up point is evaluated against the
planned profile speed, which provides another time entry - this will be the
pull-up timer value.</p>
<p>The attack is performed by flying over the IP along the desired intercept
heading to the target at the correct speed and altitude, and actuating the bomb
release button upon flyover of said IP, holding it down throughout the maneuver.
This begins the pull-up timer.
The <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a> needles will
center, then show deviation
against the initial heading course - vertical being roll, horizontal being level
to maintain current altitude. At timeout of the pull-up timer, a pull-up warning
tone will be provided, and the pull-up Lamp will illuminate; subsequently, the
Release timer will begin its count, the
horizontal ADI needle
will transition into show deviation from the intended 3.5 G pitch angle, and then stabilize once
45 degrees nose up pitch is attained. Proper timing and loading of the 3.5 G
pull-up will maintain the needle centered.</p>
<p>At timeout of the Release timer, the programmed munitions will release, the
pull-up light will turn off, and
the ADI needles will
be stowed. Once the last round is ejected, the bomb release button can be released, and the desired
escape maneuver performed.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../img/ladd.jpg" alt="ladd" /></p>
<h2 id="timed-level---tl"><a class="header" href="#timed-level---tl">Timed Level - TL</a></h2>
<p>Timed Level bombing is the most basic <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/arbcs.html">ARBCS</a> mode,
utilizing only the Release timer; the pull-up timer should be set to 000, and the High and Low
Release settings can be left at any value. The setting for the Release timer is found
based on the bomb range value determined for the chosen weapon, referencing the
desired flight altitude above the target and airspeed. This range determines the
point where the munition(s) will be released from the aircraft. An IP is chosen
relative to the bomb range distance, and the Release timer value is then
calculated using the distance between the point of release and the IP based on
the chosen airspeed.</p>
<p>The attack is performed by entering the necessary Release timer value, pushing
and holding the bomb release button upon IP flyover, and maintaining straight
and level flight at the planned airspeed and altitude at the target until the
weapons are released from the aircraft. Unlike the other LABS modes, there is no
pull-up audio or <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>
needle takeover to illustrate pitch or roll deviation- it is
simply dependent on the pilot to maintain wings level flight.</p>
<h2 id="direct"><a class="header" href="#direct">Direct</a></h2>
<p>Direct bombing is exactly as it sounds: classic, direct visual bombing, with
both dive and level bombing release passes possible. Both
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/arbcs.html">ARBCS</a>
and <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS.</a> are
excluded from this release mode, and the pilot flies the profile as found for
the intended munition in the bombing tables, setting the sight depression to
match, and hand flying the aircraft to place the pipper directly onto the target
in accordance with the desired type of attack. Once pipper on is achieved, the
bomb release button is pressed, and the selected number of munitions with the
given program settings will be released. While the most basic mode available to
the Phantom, Direct remains a reliable method when conditions permit, and can be
used against any target the crew can see - namely, targets of opportunity, or in
the CAS environment.</p>

<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../img/directlevel.jpg" alt="Direct Level" /></p>
<h2 id="offset"><a class="header" href="#offset">Offset</a></h2>
<p>Offset bombing provides a blind bombing capability, with high and low level
bombing profiles, using the full integration of
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a>, <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/nav_com/ins.html">INS</a>, and
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/radar.html">radar</a> in combination. Offset bombing can be used in both visual and
instrument conditions, to release either bombs or dispensed munitions (with the RKTS &amp; DISP
mode).</p>
<p>The setup for an Offset bomb attack is based around the selection of an IP
relative to a known target location. For a visual attack, it is called VIP - the
Visual Identification Point, and initiation of the navigation assistance is
performed with a direct flyover of the VIP. In an instrument conditions attack,
the IP is called the RIP - the Radar Identification Point, and acquisition of
this point using a radar lock in MAP-PPI mode generates a navigation
solution to the target. When chosen during planning, he VIP or RIP's position relative to
the target determines a pair of offset values (hence the name of the mode); one
in the North/South axis, the other East/West. Both offsets are noted in feet,
and the maximum amount of offset in each axis is 99,900', or 16.44 nautical
miles. Also founding during mission planning is the altitude of the IP, and
selection is made using the lookup tables for the respective weapon, altitude
above target, and speed, taking note of the bomb range. When preparing
the WRCS entries, the offsets are always referenced from the IP to the target. Selection
of an IP should be as close as possible to the target to minimize system drift
by way of smaller navigation time and distance, and approach to the IP should be
flown with a focus on minimizing maneuvering required to put the target nose on
after IP acquisition (RIP) or flyover (VIP).</p>

<h3 id="offset-rip-low-altitude-considerations"><a class="header" href="#offset-rip-low-altitude-considerations">Offset RIP Low Altitude Considerations</a></h3>
<p>Of special note in the RIP mode is the need to compensate for altitude
difference in the event the ingress to target will be flown below the altitude
of the RIP itself. Because the computations performed by
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> and navigation
system are mechanical, selecting a RIP target altitude above the course can
cause interference damage. To alleviate this, perform the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Note the approach altitude above MSL.</li>
<li>Subtract the approach altitude MSL from the RIP altitude above MSL.</li>
<li>Subtract the resulting value found in b from the approach altitude.</li>
</ol>
<p>The resulting value is used for the target altitude value, and the pilot flies
the planned approach attitude during the target freeze and insert operations as
per normal.</p>
<p>The differences in final attack procedures are described below:</p>

<p>Prior to IP overflight, the N/S and E/W offsets, release range (x10 per the
window, or using the x100 switch modifier on the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a>
initiate panel), and any desired release advance setting should be entered. Additionally, the
desired release timing and count should be selected on
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a>.</p>
<p>The Offset Visual IP attack commences on overflight of the VIP, with the
aircraft at the desired release altitude and speed; as the aircraft overflies
the VIP, the WSO simultaneously presses the Freeze Signal and Target Insert
Signal buttons on the Cursor Control Panel; doing so
initiates <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/nav_com/ins.html">INS</a> target
tracking. At this time, the
vertical <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>,
Sight, <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/wso/upfront_indicators.html#bearing-distance-heading-indicator-bdhi">BDHI</a>,
and <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#horizontal-situation-indicator">HSI</a> navigation
aids will all show offset from the calculated release point, as well as target range
on the HSI and BDHI.</p>
<p>Completion of the attack is performed by the pilot through maneuvering the
aircraft to align course to the release point, maintaining the planned release
airspeed and altitude, and, prior to reaching the release point, pressing and
holding the bomb release button. If the bomb release button is released prior to
munitions release, but at a range greater than the programmed release range, the
attack can be recovered by pressing and holding the bomb release button until
release occurs. When this takes place, the pull-up light will illuminate to
confirm drop initiation. Should the bomb release button not be pressed until
after the release point is passed, the bombs will not release until the target
is passed; ergo, the bomb button should be released to cancel the run prior to
errant bomb drop.</p>
<p>Once an attack is completed, the navigation program against the set target is maintained. The
aircraft can attempt a re-attack, although natural INS drift may
reduce the accuracy of this second attack.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../img/offsetvip.jpg" alt="Offset Visual IP" /></p>
<h3 id="offset-radar-ip"><a class="header" href="#offset-radar-ip">Offset Radar IP</a></h3>
<p>Prior to RIP Freeze and Target Insert, the N/S and E/W offsets, RIP altitude,
release range (x10 per the window, or using the x100 switch modifier on
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a>
initiate panel), and any desired release advance setting should be entered.
Additionally, the desired release timing and count should be selected on the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a>. Prior to initiation, the pilot should enter the
target area at the desired profile altitude and airspeed. The WSO should have the APQ-120 prepared
for the attack with a good <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/radar.html">radar</a> picture in MAP-PPI mode, NOR stab
mode, WIDE scan, and a range of 10 or 25 miles, with an observed return from the RIP.</p>
<p>Initiation of the attack begins with placing the Along Track cursor (presented
as a growing hemisphere on the radar display defining range to the RIP)
in proximity to, but below, the intended RIP return. When this is set, the Cross
Track cursor (a vertical line) is slewed over the RIP. Once the intersection is
defined, the WSO waits momentarily until the RIP range decreases and falls onto
the intersection. At this time, the WSO pushes the Freeze button. This initiates
radar tracking of the RIP, and provides the opportunity for the WSO to
better the intersection point between the Along Track and Cross Track cursors. Once the
precise point is attained, the WSO pushes the Insert Target button, which hands
target guidance off to the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/nav_com/ins.html">INS</a> and performs an immediate slew of
the Along Track and Cross Track cursors from the RIP to the offset target.</p>
<p>At this time, the INS presents guidance and range information on
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#attitude-director-indicator">ADI</a>, the
sight,
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/wso/upfront_indicators.html#bearing-distance-heading-indicator-bdhi">BDHI</a>, and
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/pilot/flight_director_group.html#horizontal-situation-indicator">HSI</a>. The WSO
should continue to monitor the radar
display - should the actual target appear on the display as range decreases, the
actual known altitude of the target can be entered on
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> panel and the
Along Track and Cross Track cursors can be touched up using their controls to
further increase release precision.</p>
<p>Prior to release range, the pilot must press and hold the bomb release button.
Once the bombs have released, the pull-up light will illuminate to confirm
release.</p>
<p>In the event that a RIP profile, due to breaking weather conditions, transition
to a VIP-possible profile, the offsets can be kept in
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a>, and the pilot
simply fly over the RIP, with the WSO pressing the Freeze and Target Insert
buttons simultaneously, just like a VIP attack.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../img/offsetrip.jpg" alt="Offset Radar IP" /></p>
<h2 id="target-find---tgt-find"><a class="header" href="#target-find---tgt-find">Target Find - TGT FIND</a></h2>
<p>Target Find is a utility mode derived from Offset; it does not provide a
standard release signal to the fire control and <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a> to
initiate bomb drop. It is instead used to confirm target location without release, for training
purposes, or, if necessary, perform an <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/nav_com/ins.html">INS</a> system update.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 With Pave Spike installed, Target Find <strong>can</strong> initiate a weapon release,
and so Master Arm should be kept in the OFF position until positive target
confirmation is achieved.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="target-find-ins-update"><a class="header" href="#target-find-ins-update">Target Find INS Update</a></h3>
<p><a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/nav_com/ins.html">INS</a> update is performed using offsets again a convenient VIP or
RIP, with the target location being where the INS update occurs.
The INS update switch should
be placed in SET, and the latitude and longitude coordinates of the target
entered into the navigation control panel. The RIP or VIP acquisition procedures
are used to generate the fix to the IP, with the Freeze and Target Insert
buttons used to define the target location for update. The pilot flies the
resulting guidance, while the WSO holds the INS update switch in
the FIX position. Once
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../cockpit/wso/upfront_indicators.html#bearing-distance-heading-indicator-bdhi">BDHI</a> DME
reads zero and the bearing needle passes through 90
degrees, the update switch is released, and the INS update is
complete.</p>
<h2 id="dive-toss---dt"><a class="header" href="#dive-toss---dt">Dive Toss - DT</a></h2>
<p>Dive Toss uses <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/radar.html">radar</a>
tracking, in conjunction with other aircraft sensors, to calculate the release solution in real
time. The target can be approached from any direction, airspeed, and dive angle, and
the WRCS computes the proper
release point relative to the acquired track, munition drag coefficient
setting, and any release advance control input (in conjunction
with <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a>
settings).</p>
<p>To perform a Dive Toss attack, the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/radar.html">radar</a> must be set in AIR-GRD mode,
with a 5 or 10-mile range setting. Once set, the pilot initiates the attack with the
Optical Sight in Air-to-Ground mode, and the reticle automatically cages in
elevation along the RBL. The pilot then selects DT on the Delivery Mode Knob,
places Weapon Selector Knob in BOMBS, and selects the desired Interval and
Quantity on the respective <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a> knobs. At this point, the
pilot can initiate the attack.</p>
<p>The attack is initiated in a dive. The required dive is roughly 20% higher than
that required for a Direct mode attack, as to achieve effective <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/radar.html">radar</a>
ground lock; that is, the radar must get a solid ground return, rather
than see the actual target being bombed. Once lock-on is achieved, the pilot then maneuvers to
place the pipper over the intended target, wings level, then presses and holds
the bomb button to insert radar range to
the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a>, and
then begins the desired pullout maneuver, maintaining wings level. After the pilot pushes the bomb
release button, radar ground lock is no longer required. The pullout
maneuver must maintain as constant a rate of turn as possible for maximum precision.</p>
<p>At the point where the bomb computed trajectory will intersect the target, the
<a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> provides the release signal, dropping rounds based
on the settings chosen for number and interval.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../img/divetoss.jpg" alt="Dive Toss 1" /></p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../img/divetoss2.jpg" alt="Dive Toss 2" /></p>
<h2 id="dive-laydown---dl"><a class="header" href="#dive-laydown---dl">Dive Laydown - DL</a></h2>
<p>Similar to Dive Toss, Dive Laydown is available for saturation delivery of high
drag weapons where range has little effect on the intended release parameters.
Rather than a computed release range, the bombing table release range is set
directly in the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> panel, and the pilot flies the
ballistic schedule speed (true airspeed or ground speed) at the given altitude above the target to
produce the given release range.</p>
<p>Dive Laydown is selected by placing the Delivery Mode Knob in DL, and choosing
either RKTS &amp; DISP (for dispensers/CBU only) or BOMBS. Desired release range is
entered on the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> panel, and, if necessary, the release
advance control.</p>
<p>The start of the attack is the same as Dive Toss; a higher than normal dive
angle is flown, with the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/radar.html">radar</a> in AIR-GRD mode at 5 or 10-mile range, a
solid return is generated, and the pilot then positions the pipper on the intended
target and holds the bomb release button. Once this is completed, the pilot
pulls out of the dive at the bombing table plan altitude, maintains the target
speed and heading with wings level, and the bombs release automatically at the
desired range. The key factors for accuracy in this mode are correct altitude
and pitch angle at the point of release.</p>
<p><img src="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../img/divelaydown.jpg" alt="Dive Laydown" /></p>
<h2 id="laydown---l"><a class="header" href="#laydown---l">Laydown - L</a></h2>
<p>The Laydown attack mode uses a known optical sight depression value (or IP) to
determine range to target, and releases the munitions based on a desired range
to target from the bombing tables. The profile is most useful for lower altitude
attacks using high drag munitions.</p>
<p>Setup for the Laydown attack requires the bombing table target range and
altitude above target to be entered on the <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/wrcs.html">WRCS</a> panel.
The Optical Sight should
be set to the depression noted from the tables in Air-to-Ground mode, and the
approach to the target should be flown at the true airspeed (or ground speed)
listed in the bombing tables for the parameters, wings level.
The <a href="stores/air_to_ground/bombs/../../../systems/weapon_systems/awru.html">AWRU</a>
and WRCS Release Advance settings should be entered as desired, and the Weapon Select
Knob placed in BOMBS or RKTS &amp; DISP (for dispensers only).</p>
<p>As the pipper crosses the target, the bomb button should be held until the set
spread of munitions has released.</p>

<!-- https://nara.getarchive.net/media/ -->
<h2 id="introduction-2"><a class="header" href="#introduction-2">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Crew chief (often called &quot;Chief&quot;) is the main technician
who is responsible for the assigned aircraft when it's on the ground.
This important role involves not only keeping the aircraft in good shape
by conducting maintenance, but also preparing it for flight.
The preparation for take off begins long before the aircraft crew arrives,
but the chief also directly assists the crew during startup and shutdown.</p>
<h2 id="features"><a class="header" href="#features">Features</a></h2>
<p>Our F-4 crew chief has expertise in many fields including:</p>
<ul>
<li>External power (provided by ground cart)</li>
<li>External air (provided by ground cart)</li>
<li>Engine start cartridges</li>
<li>Wheel chocks</li>
<li>Boarding ladder and boarding steps</li>
<li>Conducting different visual checks (listed below)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="visual-checks"><a class="header" href="#visual-checks">Visual Checks</a></h2>
<p>The F-4 <a href="crew_chief/../procedures/overview.html">procedures</a> include several ground checks, which objective is to
make sure that certain systems are working and set correctly.
Our F-4 crew chief can assist the pilot during following checks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Spoiler Actuator</strong></li>
<li>Air Refuelling Door</li>
<li>Speed Brakes</li>
<li>Slats and Flaps</li>
<li><strong>Flight Controls</strong></li>
<li><strong>Trim (roll and yaw)</strong></li>
<li>Tail Hook</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of them are triggered automatically
(e.g. when the chief notices speed brakes extending/retracting, he will announce it).
More advanced checks (bold ones) have to be initiated manually.</p>
<p>Some of them can also be conducted without crew chief, by acquiring visual confirmation from the WSO,
but not all of them because of the limited visibility from the cockpit.</p>
<h2 id="communication"><a class="header" href="#communication">Communication</a></h2>
<p>Both crew-members can communicate with the chief using one of two methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intercom - crew chief's headset is connected to the aircraft <a href="crew_chief/../systems/nav_com/intercom.html">intercom system</a>
using a cord providing 2-way communication similar to the communication between Pilot and WSO</li>
<li>Hand signals - the aircraft crew communicates with the chief in 1-way fashion using hand signals;
when this method is used, the crew chief features are limited;
you will be able to ask for the simpler actions like the wheel chocks removal
but the crew chief won't help you in conducting visual checks</li>
</ul>
<p>In both modes you can communicate with the crew chief using Jester wheel <strong>&quot;Crew Chief&quot;</strong> menu.
The aircraft has to be stationary and located on a friendly airfield for the menu to be available.</p>
<p>If the intercom system is set up correctly and powered up, the intercom mode will be active,
otherwise hand signals mode will be used and
the &quot;(hand signals)&quot; will be added to the &quot;Crew Chief&quot; menu name to indicate that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Since the external intercom is wired in parallel with the WSO's microphone and headset,
the ground crew and WSO can block each other during simultaneous transmissions.
In addition, the WSO's function selector switch must be in <strong>HOT MIC</strong> to allow
aircraft to ground communications.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind that you can verify the 2-way communication
by using &quot;Comms Check&quot; option.</p>

<h2 id="normal-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#normal-takeoff">Normal Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>The slats out-flaps down position is recommended for all
takeoffs. After taking the runway and completing
necessary pre-takeoff checks, engines can be run to 85%
with brakes held and nose gear steering engaged to ensure
nose gear alignment. With both engines
operating in excess of 85% and the brakes locked, there is
a possibility of rotating the tires on the wheel rims or
skidding the tires. Check for normal rpm response and
approximate readings of 450°C EGT, 4000 pph fuel flow, ¼
nozzles, and 30-40 psi oil pressure. After releasing brakes,
advance both throttles rapidly to full military power and
check rpm, exhaust temperatures and nozzle position.
WSO check the ramps fully retracted. If an afterburner
takeoff is desired, shift the throttles into the afterburner
detent and advance full forward for max thrust. Maintain
directional control with nose gear steering or rudder as
required. The rudder becomes effective for steering at
approximately 70 knots. Wheel braking should not be used
for directional control during takeoff roll. Nose gear
steering should be disengaged when rudder steering
becomes effective. If it becomes necessary to re-engage
nose gear steering at the higher speeds, rudder pedals
should be returned to neutral prior to engagement since
rudder displacement necessary for rudder steering will
generally be excessive for nose gear steering. Sufficient aft
stick should be applied prior to nose wheel liftoff speed to
attain the desired pitch attitude. As the nose rises, pitch
attitude must be controlled to maintain a 10° to 12° (first
pitch mark) nose high attitude for aircraft fly-off. Caution
must be exercised to preclude over-rotation due to
excessive aft stick rate or an extended takeoff roll due to
late lift-off. The basic takeoff attitude should be held
during acceleration and transition to a clean
configuration. Trim change and control action during this
period are normal. The AUX AIR DOORS, WHEELS, and
MASTER CAUTION lights may illuminate momentarily
as the landing gear and flaps are retracted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚨 Rapid full aft movement of the stick between
takeoff airspeed and 30 knots below takeoff
airspeed may result in the stabilator hitting the
runway with the possibility of stabilator actuator
damage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="procedures/takeoff/../../img/takeoff.jpg" alt="Takeoff" /></p>
<h2 id="no-flap-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#no-flap-takeoff">No-Flap Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>No-flap takeoffs are not recommended. However, if it is
determined that no-flap takeoffs must be performed to
satisfy mission requirements, aircrews should be aware
that takeoff roll and airspeed will be increased and: the
takeoff attitude will be slightly steeper. Stabilator
effectiveness is considerably increased and extreme
caution must be exercised to prevent over-rotation which
could result in the stabilator striking the runway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ Due to increased stabilator authority with the
flaps up, aircraft rotation can be initiated at
lower than normal airspeeds and over-rotation is
a definite possibility. If it appears that
over-rotation is occurring, positive control
movement (stick forward) must be taken to
prevent the stabilator from contacting the
runway and/or loss of aircraft control.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="minimum-run--heavy-gross-weight-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#minimum-run--heavy-gross-weight-takeoff">Minimum Run / Heavy Gross Weight Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>A minimum run/heavy gross weight takeoff (aircraft over
55,500 pounds) is accomplished in the same manner as a
normal takeoff with the following exceptions: It is
recommended that all minimum run/heavy gross weight
takeoffs be made with afterburner. During the takeoff-run,
full aft stick must be applied prior to reaching 80 knots. As
the aircraft starts to rotate, the stick should be adjusted to
maintain 10° to 12° pitch attitude for aircraft fly-off. The
possibility of a main landing gear tire failure increases
with an extended takeoff ground run under heavy gross
weight conditions. Nose wheel liftoff speed and takeoff
speed is increased during heavy gross weight conditions.
In the event of an aborted takeoff, it must be remembered
that stopping distance is greatly increased as abort speed
increases.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚨 With a combination of light gross weight and aft
CG, the minimum run takeoff technique (i.e., full
aft stick prior to reaching 80 knots) produces
rapid pitch rates during nose rotation. This
combination can exist when the radar package
and nose gun (or equivalent ballast) are not
installed.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="crosswind-takeoff"><a class="header" href="#crosswind-takeoff">Crosswind Takeoff</a></h2>
<p>Under crosswind conditions, the aircraft tends to weather
vane into the wind. The weathervaning tendency can be
easily controlled with nose gear steering. As forward speed
increases, weathervaning tendency decreases. At speeds
above 70 knots rudder effectiveness will normally be
sufficient to maintain directional control. After the nose is
lifted to takeoff attitude, the aircraft will have a tendency
to drift toward the downwind side of the runway.
Therefore, when a long time period is expected between
nose lift-off and aircraft fly-off, or when the crosswind
effect is particularly severe, nose lift-off can be delayed
accordingly. Under normal operational conditions this
action should not be required. As the aircraft leaves the
ground, it should be crabbed into the wind, wings level, to
maintain runway alignment. Takeoff in gusty crosswind
or severe wake turbulence conditions can result in an
abrupt wing low attitude at or near lift-off. When these
conditions are anticipated, use higher than computed
takeoff speed to provide additional lateral control after
lift-off.</p>
<h2 id="climb"><a class="header" href="#climb">Climb</a></h2>
<p>A simplified climb can be made by maintaining a 10° to 12°
(first pitch mark) nose high attitude until reaching 350
knots and then vary pitch as necessary to maintain 350
knots until reaching cruise Mach/TAS. Vary pitch as
necessary to maintain cruise Mach/TAS until reaching
cruise altitude. A simplified Maximum thrust climb, at
normal gross weights, can be made by maintaining a 10°
to 12° nose high attitude until reaching 350 knots and then
vary pitch as necessary to maintain 350 knots until
reaching Mach 0.9. Vary the pitch attitude as necessary to
maintain Mach 0.9 until reaching cruise altitude.</p>
<h2 id="rig-check"><a class="header" href="#rig-check">Rig Check</a></h2>
<p>A rig check shall be performed if an out-of-rig or
unintentional asymmetric load condition is suspected and
before maximum-performance/high-AOA maneuvering.
With all axes of the stab aug engaged, center the rear
cockpit ball and check that aircraft does not roll more than
2°/second with ailerons and spoilers trimmed neutral. Ifa
large amount of lateral trim (equivalent to more than 1
inch aileron down at 350 knots) is required to prevent roll,
an out-of-rig, malfunctioning stab aug, or asymmetrical
load condition exists. Do not maneuver at high angle of
attack if this condition exists.</p>
<h2 id="stab-aug-check"><a class="header" href="#stab-aug-check">Stab Aug Check</a></h2>
<p>A stab aug check shall be performed before
maximum-performance/high-AOA maneuvering. Do not
perform maximum performance maneuvers if any of the
following checks are unsatisfactory.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pull nose up with 2G acceleration and release the
stick. Aircraft should stabilize in one cycle.</li>
<li>Yaw aircraft to one ball width and release rudder.
Aircraft should stabilize in one cycle.</li>
<li>Roll to 30-45° bank and release stick. Aircraft
should maintain bank angle. Roll to level flight
and release stick. Aircraft should maintain wings
level.</li>
<li>Gradually increase AOA through 11 1/2 units and
ensure slats extend together. Decrease AOA below
10 1/2 units and ensure slats retract together.</li>

<h2 id="descent--before-landing"><a class="header" href="#descent--before-landing">Descent / Before Landing</a></h2>
<p>The Descent/Before Landing check should be
accomplished above 10,000 feet AGL and at a time when
mission/flight demands are not critical. Prior to
performing a rapid descent, the windshield and canopy
surfaces should be preheated to prevent the formation of
frost or fog. Lift becomes necessary to dump fuel during a
descent, thrust settings in excess of 85% rpm may be
required to ensure rapid inflight dumping.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Due to limited forward visibility, it is advisable to raise
the seat up before entering the pattern.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="landing-technique"><a class="header" href="#landing-technique">Landing Technique</a></h2>
<p>For a normal landing, fly the pattern as illustrated in
figure. Enter the pattern as local policy dictates.</p>
<p><img src="procedures/landing/../../img/landing_pattern.jpg" alt="Landing Pattern" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ If high angles of attack develop during the turn
to downwind, the rudder should be used as a
primary means of rollout since adverse yaw may
be introduced by the use of ailerons. Altitude may
be insufficient for recovery if uncontrolled flight
is encountered.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Avoid buffet throughout the landing pattern. Adjust
power, as necessary, to attain allowable gear lowering
airspeed. Extend landing gear and slats and flaps in level
flight on downwind. Actual flap extension may not occur
until slowing to 210 knots. Ensure slats out-flaps down
prior to initiating turn to base leg. The optimum indicated
AOA for approach is 19.2 units, and is adequate for all
gross weight and normal slat flap configurations. The
AOA aural tone system provides an audible cue to
maintain an on-speed approach (steady tone played at medium pitch).
During very gusty flight
conditions, full aileron may not be sufficient to correct a
wing low condition. When landing in gusty or crosswind
conditions, with wake turbulence, with high internal fuel
load (aft CG), or with an abnormal configuration (slats in,
asymmetric slats or slats partially extended), a 17 unit
AOA approach is recommended. A transition to ON
SPEED and a flared landing will reduce the touchdown
speed. The AOA indexer and aural tone indications
remain unaffected. Establish and maintain On Speed
angle-of-attack on the base leg or final approach,
adjusting pitch attitude to maintain AOA and power to
maintain desired glide slope/rate of descent. Cross-check
computed airspeed and On Speed AOA to detect gross
errors in AOA. When the aircraft reaches 20 to 30 feet
altitude above the ground, ground effect will tend to rotate
the aircraft in the nose-down direction. Maintaining pitch
attitude will result in transition to a slightly slow
indication at touch-down which is desired. Flying a 2 1/2°
to 3° glide slope will produce an approach rate of descent
of about 700 feet per minute. Sink rate at touchdown will
be appreciably reduced by ground effect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚨 Flying a steeper than normal final approach or
not maintaining pitch attitude when entering
ground effect, can cause touchdown sink rates to
exceed the design limit of the main landing gear
struts.</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- (Refer to section V for touchdown sink
rates vs gross weight limitations.) -->
<p>At touchdown, reduce power to idle and deploy drag chute.
Use full aft stick to help decelerate. Use rudder and
ailerons for directional control down to 70 knots then use
differential braking. Nose gear steering should not be
required for directional control in light crosswind
conditions. However, if rudder, aileron, and/or
differential braking are not effective in maintaining
directional control, use nose gear steering as required.
Engage nose gear steering only with the rudder at or near
neutral.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ Nose gear steering malfunctions can cause loss of
directional control if engaged at high ground
speed; therefore, it should not be engaged above
taxi speed unless required to maintain directional
control during crosswind landing conditions. If no
response is noted or unscheduled steering
responses are detected when engaging nose gear
steering, disengage immediately and do not
reengage.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>During braking, cycling of the anti-skid system can be
detected by a change in longitudinal deceleration. Cycling
may not be apparent when braking at high speed
immediately after landing, with drag chute failure, or
with a wet or icy runway. Do not misinterpret this as
anti-skid failure.</p>
<h2 id="no-flap-landing"><a class="header" href="#no-flap-landing">No-Flap Landing</a></h2>

<!-- TODO: add specific procedure link -->
<h2 id="short-field-landing"><a class="header" href="#short-field-landing">Short Field Landing</a></h2>
<p>Short field landings require that normal final approach
procedures be followed with precision and the aircraft be

increases both aerodynamic drag and wheel brake
effectiveness. Apply maximum braking by fully
depressing the brake pedals to the pedal stops as soon as
the nose gear is on the ground and nose gear steering is
engaged. Nose gear steering should be used to maintain
runway alignment and supplemented with differential
braking only if required.</p>
<p>Operation on the AM-2 aluminum mat is similar to that
conducted on a concrete runway of equivalent size.
Arrestment should be regarded as an emergency
procedure. However, since the aircraft is fully suitable for
arrested landings, extremely adverse meteorological or
operational conditions may warrant consideration of
landing into a suitable approach-end arresting gear.</p>
<h2 id="crosswind-landing-dry-runway"><a class="header" href="#crosswind-landing-dry-runway">Crosswind Landing (Dry Runway)</a></h2>
<p>Carefully compensate for crosswind in the traffic pattern
to guard against undershooting or overshooting the final
turn. Fly the final approach course with the aircraft
ground track properly aligned with the runway. The
crosswind may be compensated for either by using the
wing low method, the crab method, or a combination of the
two. When using the wing low method, the ARI can be
overpowered by use of the rudder pedals or the ARI can be
disengaged by pulling the rudder trim circuit breaker. If
the crab method is employed, the aircraft heading should
be aligned with the runway just prior to touchdown. After
touchdown, use rudder, aileron and spoiler, and nose gear
steering as required to maintain directional control.
Crosswind effect on the aircraft is not severe; however,
rudder, differential braking, and/or nose gear steering
must be used as required to maintain alignment with the
runway. Use of the drag chute intensifies the weather
vane effect for any given deployment condition. The
weather vane effect increases as the forward velocity of
the aircraft decreases, therefore, if the drag chute is to be
used, it should be used at the initial portion rather than
the latter portion of the landing roll. This also assures use
of the drag chute in the speed region where it is most
effective. If the drag chute is used and excessive
weathervaning is encountered, jettison drag chute. Since
the nose gear will rapidly assume a position relative to the
rudder pedals, nose gear steering should be initiated with
the rudder pedals at or near the neutral position. For this
reason the use of nose gear steering is advocated early in
the landing roll rather than at a time when large amounts
of rudder are required to hold the aircraft aligned on the
runway. The most important aspect of directional control
under crosswind conditions is keeping the aircraft
precisely aligned with the runway rather than trying to
correct back to the runway centerline after it has deviated.</p>

<h2 id="wet-or-icy-runway-landing"><a class="header" href="#wet-or-icy-runway-landing">Wet or Icy Runway Landing</a></h2>
<p>Wet or icy runway conditions pose severe problems in
directional control and braking effectiveness. On wet
runways, these problems are primarily the result of
hydroplaning where the tire rides on a thin layer of water
and produces little or no traction. The probability of
hydroplaning increases with increased water depth,
increased ground speed, decreased tire pressure and
decreased tire tread depth and is also affected by runway
surface texture and tire tread design. Hydroplaning can
occur on runways which appear only damp if severe
braking is applied at high speeds. Hydroplaning and glare
ice present essentially the same problems. Due to the
reduced directional control, all landings on a wet or icy
runway should be made utilizing a crosswind technique.
Refer to the Crosswind Landing Guide (figure 2-7) to
determine the advisability of making an approach-end
engagement. The pilot should also consider the
desirability of delaying the landing to permit the runway
to dry or diverting to another field. Gross weight should be
reduced to the minimum practicable. Plan the pattern to
be well established on final with the aircraft tracking
straight down the runway centerline with an ON SPEED
indication. Use a wings - level crab, if required, to
maintain the track. Establish the rate of descent at 800
fpm (slightly steeper than normal) and plan to touchdown
on the centerline within the first 500 feet. Make a firm
touchdown (500-600 fpm) while maintaining the
wings-level crab. Immediately after touchdown retard the
throttles to idle. Do not attempt to align the aircraft
heading with the runway as this will result in a drift off
the runway if the aircraft is sliding or hydroplaning.
Maintain full forward stick to increase nosewheel
traction. As wheel cornering capability overcomes
aerodynamic effects the aircraft will align itself with the
runway. Do not attempt to hasten this process. When the
aircraft heading is aligned with the runway centerline,
deploy the drag chute. Be prepared to jettison the drag
chute if the weathervaning effect interferes with
maintaining the track straight down the runway
centerline. Nose gear steering is the primary method of
directional control and should be utilized as early as
possible. Nose gear steering should be engaged only with
the rudder pedals at or near neutral. When directional
control is firmly established utilize maximum anti-skid
braking. Brake pedals must be fully depressed to achieve
maximum deceleration. At high speeds the braking
potential will be very low and little deceleration will be
felt. As braking potential increases with decreasing speed,
the anti-skid system will increase deceleration
accordingly. Unless the pilot is familiar with the variables
in braking potential, the low deceleration at high speed
may be mistakenly interpreted as a brake or anti-skid
failure.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>🚨 Rubber deposits on the last 2000 feet of wet
runway make directional control a difficult
problem even at very low speeds. Braking should
be started in sufficient time so as not to require
excessive braking on the last portion of the
runway.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="heavy-gross-weight-landing"><a class="header" href="#heavy-gross-weight-landing">Heavy Gross Weight Landing</a></h2>
<p>The heavy gross weight landing pattern is the same as the
basic pattern shown in figure 2-6 with the exception that
it should be expanded slightly to compensate for the lower
maneuvering capability of the heavy gross weight aircraft
at low speeds. As in the normal pattern, an on-speed
indication on the indexer will provide the optimum angle
of attack and airspeed for the aircraft in the landing
configuration for both level flight and maneuvering flight.
Refer to Performance Data, appendix A, for airspeed
versus gross weight at approach AOA.</p>
<h2 id="go-around"><a class="header" href="#go-around">Go-Around</a></h2>
<p>Any decision to go around should be made as early as
possible. When the decision to go around is made,
smoothly increase thrust to military (afterburner if
required). Do not attempt to rotate the nose or stop
rate-of-descent until adequate airspeed is built up.
Continue to use the on speed indication as the optimum
angle of attack until level flight is attained. As airspeed
increases, establish normal takeoff attitude, retract gear
when a positive rate of climb is established, retract slats
and flaps at a safe airspeed (180 knots minimum) and go
around. Rudder jumps may occur during flap retraction
with lateral stick input. For a closed pattern, accomplish
a climbing 180° turn to roll out on downwind at 220 to 250
knots. Refer to Go-Around, figure 2-8. During go-around
a rapid trim change is required to preclude high forward
stick forces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>⚠️ Do not exceed 18 units AOA during go-around
with gear retracted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="touch-and-go"><a class="header" href="#touch-and-go">Touch-And-Go</a></h2>
<p>After making a normal approach and touchdown,
smoothly advance throttles to full military power. Apply
aft stick until the nose rotates 10° to 12° of pitch attitude
maintaining this attitude until the aircraft is flying. When
definitely airborne retract the gear, followed by the flaps
as the aircraft accelerates through 180 knots minimum.</p>

<tr><td>7</td><td>Mode Switch</td><td>C</td></tr>
<tr><td>8</td><td>Alarm Check</td><td>The KY-28 will perform an automatic alarm check when the mode switch is set to C and the power knob is set to On. The check will continue for about 2 seconds after power is applied. During this time a steady, unbroken 1200 Hz tone is heard in the headsets. Upon successful completion of the check, the 1200 Hz tone is interrupted at a 2.3 Hz rate.</td></tr>
<tr><td>9</td><td>Clear Interrupted Tone</td><td>Momentarily position the microphone button to UHF to clear the interrupted tone. When the microphone button is released, the KY-28 reverts to the standby condition and is ready for either transmission or reception. If the unit fails to pass the alarm check, the steady 1200 Hz tone continues and further cipher operation is inhibited.</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Alarm Check Failure</td><td>Note: If the KY-28 fails the alarm check, the power knob must be set to OFF and the mode switch to P (plain) to enable conventional UHF communications.</td></tr>
<tr><td>11</td><td>Transmit Ciphered Messages</td><td>To transmit ciphered messages, position the microphone button to UHF and wait until a momentary tone is heard before voice input. With the power knob set to ON, the momentary tone is delayed 0.5 seconds after pressing the microphone button. During this time, an encryption check is performed and the sync preamble is transmitted to receiving stations. If the encryption check fails, a 1200 Hz tone interrupted at a 2.3 Hz rate is presented in the headsets and cipher transmission is not possible. If the encryption check succeeds, a momentary tone is heard in the headsets.</td></tr>
<tr><td>12</td><td>Cipher Radio Communications</td><td>After the momentary tone is heard, establish two-way cipher radio communications with a cooperating station and check for readability and signal strength and/or transmit your message. Upon releasing the microphone button, the KY-28 will return to the standby condition. Simultaneous transmission by two or more stations on the same frequency is not possible and may result in garbled messages or loss of synchronization.</td></tr>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="emergency-procedures"><a class="header" href="#emergency-procedures">Emergency Procedures</a></h1>
<!-- would be cool to have some emergency "frame" (2-colored stripe around page) like in manual -->
<p>This section contains procedures to be followed to correct
an emergency condition. These procedures will insure
maximum safety for the crew and/or aircraft until a safe
landing or other appropriate action is accomplished. The
procedures are arranged in the most desirable sequence
for the majority of cases; therefore, the steps should be
performed in the listed sequence unless the pilot can
determine a good cause for deviation. Multiple
emergencies, adverse weather, and other peculiar
conditions may require modification of these procedures.
The critical items <strong>(BOLD FACE LETTERS)</strong> contained in the
various emergency procedures cover the most adverse
conditions. Aircrew members should be able to accomplish
bold face procedures without reference to the checklist.
The nature and severity of the encountered emergency
will dictate the necessity for complying with the critical
items in their entirety. It is essential, therefore, that
aircrews determine the correct course of action by use of
common sense and sound judgement. As soon as possible,
the pilot should notify the WSO, flight or flight leader, and
tower of any existing emergency and of the intended
action.</p>
<p>The terms &quot;Land as soon as <strong>possible</strong>&quot; and &quot;Land as soon
as <strong>practical</strong>&quot; are used in this section. These terms are
defined as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Land as soon as possible</strong> - An emergency will be declared.
A landing should be accomplished at the nearest suitable
airfield considering the severity of the emergency,
weather conditions, field facilities, ambient lighting,
aircraft gross weight, and command guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Land as soon as practical</strong> - Emergency conditions are less
urgent, and although the mission is. to be terminated, the
degree of the emergency is such that an immediate
landing at .the nearest adequate airfield may not be
necessary.</p>
<p>The following basic rules apply to all aircraft emergencies
and should be thoroughly understood by all aircrew:</p>
<ol>
<li>Maintain aircraft control.</li>
<li>Analyze the situation and take proper action.</li>
<li>Land as soon as practical.</li>
</ol>
<!-- TODO: maybe add warning from the flight manual -->

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dcs"><a class="header" href="#dcs">DCS</a></h1>
<p>This chapter contains systems, settings and interfaces specific to
the simulation of the Phantom inside DCS.</p>
<p>Of special note is a <a href="dcs/modding/overview.html">modding guide</a> and explanation available
to <a href="dcs/mission_editor.html">mission designers</a>.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/livery_helo.jpg" alt="Helicopter with Anime Livery" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="special-options"><a class="header" href="#special-options">Special Options</a></h1>
<p>The Phantom offers several options that can be set within the <em>Special Option</em>
menu in DCS.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/special_options.jpg" alt="Special Option Menu" /></p>
<h2 id="stick-deflection-limit"><a class="header" href="#stick-deflection-limit">Stick Deflection Limit</a></h2>
<p>Limits the maximum force in lbf (Pound-Force), i.e. strength, the pilot is able
to pull the stick with.</p>
<p>This effect is mostly seen when controlling the aircraft during high G maneuvers
and can prevent accidentally pulling extreme Gs.</p>
<h2 id="stick-force-blending"><a class="header" href="#stick-force-blending">Stick Force Blending</a></h2>
<p>When maximum movement of the stick would result in excessive forces being
generated, having this activated will scale down the generated force to improve
handling precision, but also can help to prevent accidentally pulling extreme
Gs.</p>
<h2 id="roll-breakout-point"><a class="header" href="#roll-breakout-point">Roll Breakout Point</a></h2>
<p>Percentage of stick input after which the Roll and Trim system will recognize
pilot input and stop overwriting and fighting it.</p>
<h2 id="afterburner-detent"><a class="header" href="#afterburner-detent">Afterburner Detent</a></h2>
<p>Two options to define at which point of the physical hardware throttle input (0
to 100%) the aircraft will light the afterburner.</p>
<p>That is, if set to 80%, the MIL power range of the aircraft will be commanded
between 0% and 80% of your physical throttle, while the remaining 20% will
control the afterburner range.</p>
<p>The deadzone option can be used to split the points in the range at which the
afterburner will be turned on and off. For example, setting 2% for the deadzone
and 80% for the detent results in afterburner activation at 82% and deactivation
at 78% of throttle input.</p>
<h2 id="randomize-system-inputs"><a class="header" href="#randomize-system-inputs">Randomize System Inputs</a></h2>
<p>When unchecked, during cold start all switches and knobs will be in their
initial OFF positions. Allowing for a quick start by just following procedures.</p>
<p>When checked, switch positions will be randomized during cold-start, as if the
previous pilot did not properly return everything back to their initial
positions. To ensure a correct startup, the crew hence must check and confirm
each switch in the proper position before following a cold-start procedure.</p>
<h2 id="performance-balancer"><a class="header" href="#performance-balancer">Performance Balancer</a></h2>
<p>Under normal conditions, the systems and components in the aircraft are
simulated with a fixed update-rate.</p>
<p>With this option checked, the update rate of some less important systems (such
as animations) is scaled dynamically based on the current CPU usage. This means
that if the system has a hard time keeping high FPS, the rate on which less
important systems are simulated is dynamically tuned down to stress the CPU less
and possibly achieve higher FPS.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Due to dynamic nature of this system, having it enabled might result in
broken track/replay files.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="disable-wso-multi-crew-controls"><a class="header" href="#disable-wso-multi-crew-controls">Disable WSO Multi-Crew Controls</a></h2>
<p>When checked, when playing as WSO in Multiplayer with a human pilot, any stick
and throttle input will be deactivated to prevent accidentally messing with the
pilot and screwing up the flight.</p>
<h2 id="jester-landing-callouts"><a class="header" href="#jester-landing-callouts">Jester Landing Callouts</a></h2>
<p>If enabled, Jester will assist the pilot during landing by calling out aircraft
altitude, similar as seen in civilian aviation.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Real Phantom WSOs did not assist during landing.</p>

<p><img src="dcs/../img/ingame_manual.jpg" alt="Embedded Manual" /></p>
<p>This manual is embedded into the game and can be read while flying.</p>
<p>It also offers a way to explain switches in the cockpit directly by opening the
manual scrolled right to the spot explaining the corresponding switch.</p>
<h2 id="controls-2"><a class="header" href="#controls-2">Controls</a></h2>
<p>The default hotkeys are:</p>
<ul>
<li><kbd>LSHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> - open the manual</li>
<li><kbd>LCTRL</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> - close the manual</li>
<li><kbd>M</kbd> (hold while clicking a switch) - open the manual to explain the
switch</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bombing-computer"><a class="header" href="#bombing-computer">Bombing Computer</a></h1>
<p>The bombing calculator provides the pilot and WSO with an easy way to calculate the needed values
for the different bombing modes. You can use it to calculate every value (except for drag
coefficient) that you need to drop precise ordinance on your target. It is opened with the hotkey
<kbd>RCTRL</kbd>+<kbd>B</kbd> and can be closed with the same hotkey in-game. You can also bind it
to a desired button in the controls tab.</p>

<p>To aid in crew coordination, during startup and planning, a commonly employed

<p><img src="dcs/../img/spotting_circle_setup.jpg" alt="Spotting Circle Setup" /></p>
<p>The circle drawn by the Pilot and the WSO will now roughly point in the same

<p>For example, if the Pilot spots a target, they can tell the WSO:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;There is a target 100m right to the circle.&quot;</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="recorders"><a class="header" href="#recorders">Recorders</a></h1>
<p>The aircraft is equipped with multiple recording devices, such as the AVTR or
the Gun Camera.</p>
<p>They are capable of recording in-game footage, which is accessible outside of
the game in the <strong>Saved Games</strong> folder. A possible path might for example look
like:</p>

<p>The F-4 has several special options selectable in the Mission Editor.</p>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/mission_editor_special_options.jpg" alt="Special Options" /></p>
<h2 id="condition-and-wear"><a class="header" href="#condition-and-wear">Condition and Wear</a></h2>
<p>All components of the aircraft simulate wear individually, yielding a unique
experience on each spawn, but also based on how the F-4 is flown.</p>
<p>It is generally differentiated between <strong>Condition</strong> and the <strong>Wear and Tear</strong>,
both are dynamic at spawn and can be influenced throughout a mission by various
factors such as forces, temperature and also combat damage.</p>
<p>The aircraft has thousands of components that are subject to this system. One
concrete example would be the speed of the Pave Spike Targeting Pod elevation
gimbal motor. Under perfect condition, it is supposed to have a speed of 60
degrees per second. However, a factory generally can not ensure this to always
be the case and accepts a variance, for example it must be within 1% error.</p>
<p>Mathematically, variance is simulated as <strong>normal distribution</strong>, consisting of
the parameters</p>
<ul>
<li>μ (Mu, mean) - the value it would have under perfect condition</li>
<li>σ (Sigma) - the variance of the value</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="dcs/../img/normal_distribution.jpg" alt="Normal Distribution" /></p>
<p>Around 70% of times the value will be within one unit of σ, in 95% of cases it
will be within 2 units of σ. Extreme cases above 3 units of σ are possible, but
very rare.</p>
<p>Said motor has for example a σ value of 3% around 60 degrees per second, meaning
that the vast majority of targeting pods will be produced with a motor capable
of moving the elevation gimbal between 58 and 62 degrees per second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>💡 Variance goes in both directions, your Phantom can also be faster than it
is supposed to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="aircraft-condition"><a class="header" href="#aircraft-condition">Aircraft Condition</a></h3>
<p>An aircraft's condition generally refers to its factory and production quality.
For example, during war times a factory might run out of supplies and reduce
their acceptance criteria during production, generally increasing variance in
individual component performance.</p>
<p>Mission designers can control this aspect with the <strong>Aircraft Condition</strong>
slider, indicating quality from 0% (poor quality) to 100% (high quality).</p>
<p>For the Pave Spike motor this means that, when set to 0%, its speed variance σ
will increase from 3% to 8%, causing majority of pods to be produced with a
speed between 55 and 65 degrees per second instead.</p>
<p>Aircraft condition will always still be within limits that a manufacturer might
find reasonably acceptable. The aircraft is always still fully functional and
operational.</p>
<h3 id="aircraft-wear-and-tear"><a class="header" href="#aircraft-wear-and-tear">Aircraft Wear and Tear</a></h3>
<p>Additionally to production quality, components can degrade during service based
on time since the last service, external factors like temperature and weather,
aggressive flying involving a lot of forces on the airframe, as well as combat
damage.</p>
<p>Mission designers can control this aspect with the <strong>Aircraft Wear and Tear</strong>
slider, indicating wear from 0% (no wear) to 100% (a lot of wear), or even
beyond that. For an aircraft that was just repaired and came fresh out of
service, 0% is appropriate. 100% refers to the latest point at which an aircraft
would reasonably be send back for maintenance, as it starts being less effective
in practice. Values beyond, such as 500%, can be used to represent scenarios in
which pilots are forced to fly an aircraft that operates exceptionally below its
expected performance level. It is still somewhat usable, nothing is straight out
broken, but components just do not behave within acceptable parameters anymore.</p>
<p>For the Pave Spike motor this means that, when set to 100% wear, its speed
variance σ will additionally increase by 20%. Assuming a good initial starting
condition, the motor will at that point likely operate between 45 and 75 degrees
per second.</p>

<p>The variance system at initial spawn can be turned off with this checkbox, if
desired. Components will then start with their mean value μ, without any
variance.</p>
<p>This is especially interesting for competitions, where both sides should start
with the same conditions for fairness.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="voice-files"><a class="header" href="#voice-files">Voice Files</a></h1>
<p>Jesters entire library of phrases can be found in the Mod-Folder, for example:</p>
<p><code>G:\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\Sounds\Jester</code></p>
<p>When editing sounds, it is necessary to restart DCS. Just reloading the mission
is not enough for chances to take effect.</p>
<h2 id="sdef"><a class="header" href="#sdef">sdef</a></h2>
<p>For DCS to understand the files, sound-definition-files (sdef) are located in:</p>
<p><code>G:\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\Sounds\sdef\Jester</code></p>
<p>A sdef-file is a plain text-file that can be edited with any text-editor. Next to locating the
actual sound file, it can define properties such as gain or fade-in/-out effects,
as well as positioning the sound effect it within the world when played.</p>
<pre><code class="language-ini">wave = &quot;Jester/Contacts/theresafriend4shipbraHI1&quot;

<p>This gives a quick overview of Lua, which Jester is primarily coded in; and
explains the Jester API itself.</p>

</ul>
<h3 id="tables"><a class="header" href="#tables">Tables</a></h3>
<p>Lua in itself is a fairly simple language with not too many features. It
primarily revolves around the use of tables. Tables can be compared to arrays,
lists and dictionaries, or maps.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- dictionary
local person = {
  name = &quot;John&quot;,
  age = 20,
}

-- array/list
local fruits = { &quot;Orange&quot;, &quot;Apple&quot;, &quot;Lemon&quot; }
</code></pre>
<p>Arrays also implicitly decay to dictionaries with ascending keys <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, etc.</p>
<p>Access can be either in a lookup-style <code>person[&quot;age&quot;] = 21</code>, or like fields
<code>person.age = 21</code>.</p>
<p>In Lua, indices start <strong>counting at 1:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">print(fruits[1]) -- Orange
</code></pre>
<p>The length of a table can be accessed using <code>#</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- appending to a table
fruits[#fruits + 1] = &quot;Cherry&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Anything not explicitly set is given the value <code>nil</code>.</p>
<h3 id="syntax-example"><a class="header" href="#syntax-example">Syntax example</a></h3>
<pre><code class="language-lua">function ageCheck(name, age)
  if age &lt; 18 then
    print(&quot;Sorry&quot;, name)
  else
    print(&quot;Okay&quot;, name)
  end
end
</code></pre>
<h3 id="classes"><a class="header" href="#classes">Classes</a></h3>
<p>Lua itself does not provide classes. However, we created a framework to add
class-like structures to Lua:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local Class = require('base.Class')

local Person = Class()
Person.name = nil -- fields
Person.age = nil

function Person:Constructor(name, age)
  self.name = name
  self.age = age
end

Person:Seal() -- Prevent adding/removing more values/functions to it
</code></pre>
<p>The framework also supports inheritance:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local Class = require('base.Class')
local Behavior = require('base.Behavior')

local AssistAAR = Class(Behavior) -- inherits from Behavior
</code></pre>
<h2 id="debugging"><a class="header" href="#debugging">Debugging</a></h2>
<p>Unfortunately, we do not have any Lua debugger setup. One has to rely on caveman
debugging with prints:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">print(&quot;hello world&quot;)
print(&quot;Person:&quot;, person)
print(&quot;Check:&quot;, foo, bar, baz)
</code></pre>
<p>Which can then be seen in console. Note that it might be necessary to
periodically call <code>io.flush()</code> to actually see the prints.</p>
<p>We also provide a Lua playground in <code>WizardJester.lua</code>, which is always executed
directly on startup.</p>
<p>It is also possible to edit Lua files while DCS runs, without restarting the
game. Simply edit a LUA file and then reload the DCS mission with
<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> and the new Lua file will be effective.</p>
<h2 id="jester-api"><a class="header" href="#jester-api">Jester API</a></h2>
<p>Jesters logic is divided into 6 layers of abstraction:</p>
<ul>
<li>Intention (<em>WIP</em>)</li>
<li>Plan (<em>WIP</em>)</li>
<li>Situation</li>
<li>Behavior</li>
<li>Task</li>
<li>Action</li>
</ul>
<p>Code is placed in the Mod-Folder, for example:</p>
<p><code>G:\DCS World OpenBeta\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\Jester</code></p>
<h3 id="example"><a class="header" href="#example">Example</a></h3>
<p>As an example that touches most of the layers, we want to create a feature that
lets Jester report the current speed every couple of seconds during flight.</p>
<p>Therefore, we start with a Situation. A situation needs an activation and
deactivation <strong>Condition:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- Airborne.lua
local Class = require 'base.Class'
local Condition = require 'base.Condition'

local Airborne = {}
Airborne.True = Class(Condition)
Airborne.False = Class(Condition)

function IsAirborne()
  -- details on observations later
  return GetJester().awareness:GetObservation(&quot;airborne&quot;) or false
end

function Airborne.True:Check()
  return IsAirborne() -- activation condition
end

function Airborne.False:Check()
  return not IsAirborne() -- deactivation condition
end

Airborne.True:Seal()
Airborne.False:Seal()
return Airborne
</code></pre>
<p>Activation and deactivation conditions do not necessarily have to be the same.</p>
<p>Now, we can use this condition in our <code>Flight</code> situation and add our desired
behavior:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- Flight.lua
local Class = require 'base.Class'
local Situation = require 'base.Situation'
local Airborne = require 'conditions.Airborne'
local ReportSpeed = require 'behaviors.ReportSpeed'
-- behavior will be defined in the next step

local Flight = Class(Situation)

-- it simply expects a class with a :Check() method
Flight:AddActivationConditions(Airborne.True:new())
Flight:AddDeactivationConditions(Airborne.False:new())

function Flight:OnActivation()
  self:AddBehavior(ReportSpeed) -- start our behavior
end

function Flight:OnDeactivation()
  self:RemoveBehavior(ReportSpeed) -- stop our behavior
end

Flight:Seal()
return Flight
</code></pre>
<p>The situation also has to be registered in <code>F-4E_WSO.lua</code> (<em>WIP, might change
again</em>):</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- in F-4E_WSO.lua
...
function CreateF4E_WSOJester()
  ...
  wso::AddSituations(Flight:new())
  ...
end
</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can define our behavior:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- ReportSpeed.lua
local Class = require('base.Class')
local Behavior = require('base.Behavior')
local SaySpeed = require('tasks.common.SaySpeed')
-- Task will be defined in the next step

local ReportSpeed = Class(Behavior)

function ReportSpeed:Constructor()
  Behavior.Constructor(self)
end

function ReportSpeed:Tick()
  -- this is called periodically
  local task = SaySpeed:new(...) -- access to speed explained later
  GetJester():AddTask(task)
end

ReportSpeed:Seal()
return ReportSpeed
</code></pre>
<p>Now, this would let Jester say something on every tick, a bit too verbose. To
improve on this, the Urge-system has been created. We can wrap our task in an
<code>Urge</code> and it will only be called on a set interval (which is automatically
applied some variance based on Jesters fixation and stress level):</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- ReportSpeed.lua
local Class = require('base.Class')
local Behavior = require('base.Behavior')
local Urge = require('base.Urge') -- added
local StressReaction = require('base.StressReaction') -- added
local SaySpeed = require('tasks.common.SaySpeed')

local ReportSpeed = Class(Behavior)

function ReportSpeed:Constructor()
  Behavior.Constructor(self)

  -- logic of the behavior
  local say_speed = function ()
    -- very simple in this case,
    -- but could also trigger multiple tasks based on conditions, if desired
    local task = SaySpeed:new(...)
    GetJester():AddTask(task)
    return {task}
  end

  -- define the urge
  self.urge = Urge:new({
    time_to_release = s(10), -- baseline interval (10s now)
    on_release_function = say_speed, -- what to execute
    stress_reaction = StressReaction.ignorance, -- how important is this to Jester
  })
  self.urge:Restart() -- start it
end

function ReportSpeed:Tick()
  -- we could also modify the urge now, if desired
  -- for example increasing the stress level
  self.urge:Tick() -- tick it
end

ReportSpeed:Seal()
return ReportSpeed
</code></pre>
<p>The next step is to create the actual Task that will take care of reporting the
given speed:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- SaySpeed.lua
local Class = require('base.Class')
local Task = require('base.Task')
local SayAction = require('actions.SayAction')

local SaySpeed = Class(Task)

function SaySpeed:Constructor(speed)
  Task.Constructor(self)

  local on_activation = function()
    if speed &lt; kt(500) then
      -- see PhrasesList.txt for all supported voice lines
      self:AddAction(SayAction('awareness/wereslow'))
    else
      self:AddAction(SayAction('awareness/werefast'))
    end
  end

  self:AddOnActivationCallback(on_activation)
end

SaySpeed:Seal()
return SaySpeed
</code></pre>
<p>The last part is the final <code>Action</code>, in our case <code>SayAction</code>. Actions are
usually very generic and basic. In most cases, the existing <code>SayAction</code> will be
all thats needed. Refer to <code>SayAction.lua</code> for how it works.</p>
<p>If a behavior has no extra need for a specific task and just wants to say a
phrase, one can also directly use <code>SayTask</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- in a Behaviors logic
...
local task = SayTask:new('misc/outoffuel')
GetJester():AddTask(task)
...
</code></pre>
<h3 id="lreal-and-units"><a class="header" href="#lreal-and-units">LReal and units</a></h3>
<p>A very common need is to work with real values and units, such as speed or time.
Therefore, we have <code>LReal</code>s, with units defined in <code>LUnit</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local time = min(15)
local speed = kt(500)
local fuel = lb(12000)

if time &gt; s(10) then
  print(&quot;foo&quot;)
end

time = time - s(40)
</code></pre>
<p>Careful when doing scalar operations:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- correct
time *= 2

-- incorrect
time *= s(2)
</code></pre>
<p>Latter would result in an invalid <code>LReal</code>, which can be checked for using
<code>time:IsValid()</code>.</p>
<p>If necessary, values can be converted to another unit:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local timeInSeconds = time:ConvertTo(s)
print(&quot;Time:&quot;, timeInSeconds)
</code></pre>
<p><code>time.value</code> would access the raw underlying number.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-properties"><a class="header" href="#accessing-properties">Accessing properties</a></h3>
<p>Lua has full access to all <code>Property</code>s defined in our components and can access
them easily with <code>GetProperty</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">function GetTotalFuelQuantity()
  local gauge_readout = GetProperty(
    &quot;/Pilot Fuel Quantity Indicator/Fuel Meter&quot;, -- path
    &quot;Internal Fuel Quantity Indication&quot; -- property name
  ).value

  return gauge_readout or lb(10000)
end
</code></pre>
<p><code>GetProperty</code> expects the full path to the component within the component-tree
(that are all names of parent components), they must start with <code>/</code> to
indicate an absolute path.</p>
<p>The returned value is a wrapper <code>Property</code> object. Access to the underlying
value (in this case a <code>LReal</code> with unit <code>Pounds</code>) is given by
<code>GetProperty(...).value</code>.</p>
<h3 id="observations-and-senses"><a class="header" href="#observations-and-senses">Observations and Senses</a></h3>
<p>Additionally to direct property access, Jester has an Observation-System. The
system allows to make frequently used data accessible in an easy way, or also to
provide more complex data, i.e. coming from the DCS SDK.</p>
<p>Observations are part of <code>Sense</code>s, of which Jester has several (eyes, ears, …).
As of now, most of them are <em>WIP</em>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local isAirborne = GetJester().awareness:GetObservation(&quot;airborne&quot;) or false
</code></pre>
<h2 id="interactions"><a class="header" href="#interactions">Interactions</a></h2>
<p>One key aspect of Jester is that he can interact with the cockpit by clicking
switches, buttons and turning knobs.</p>
<p>Thefore, the API offers methods such as <code>Click</code> and <code>ClickKnob</code> based on device
and command IDs:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">-- sends value 1 via command WSO_EJECT_INSTANT to device EJECTION_SEAT_SYSTEM
Click(devices.EJECTION_SEAT_SYSTEM, device_commands.WSO_EJECT_INSTANT, 1)

-- sends the value corresponding to position 2 on a 7-position knob
ClickKnob(devices.HUD_AN_ASG_26, device_commands.HUD_SelectHUDMode, 2, 7)
</code></pre>
<p>See <code>devices.lua</code> for all available devices and likewise <code>command_defs.lua</code> for
the commands.</p>
<p>In general, Knobs and 2-pos switches use the range <code>[0, 1]</code> for values, while
3-pos switches often (but not always) use <code>[-1, +1]</code>. For 3-pos switches <code>-1</code> is
usually used to move a 3-pos switch down, <code>+1</code> to move it up - but some switches
have a different orientation. See <code>default.lua</code> and <code>clickabledata.lua</code> to learn
more about a specific switch and how it reacts to values.</p>
<h2 id="events"><a class="header" href="#events">Events</a></h2>
<p>Next to clicking switches, Jester can react to events send either from C++ or
also from within Lua. The system follows a simple observer/listener pattern:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">ListenTo(&quot;go_silent&quot;, function()
  Click(devices.RADAR, device_commands.RADAR_Power_Knob_RIO, 3, 5) -- Standby
end)
</code></pre>
<p>with:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">if is_aar then
  DispatchEvent(&quot;go_silent&quot;)
end
</code></pre>
<h2 id="ui"><a class="header" href="#ui">UI</a></h2>
<p>Jester provides two types of user interfaces. A wheel with selectable options
and a dialog with questions and selectable answers that are shown on demand. See
<a href="dcs/modding/jester/wheel_ui.html">Wheel UI</a> and <a href="dcs/modding/jester/dialog_ui.html">Dialog UI</a> for more.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="wheel-ui"><a class="header" href="#wheel-ui">Wheel UI</a></h1>
<p>Jester Wheel consists of a web-based frontend and offers an API exposed to Lua
for modifying its content and reacting to actions.</p>
<h2 id="frontend"><a class="header" href="#frontend">Frontend</a></h2>
<p>The frontend is a <a href="https://pixijs.com/">Pixi JS</a> based website defined in</p>
<p><code>f-4e\ModFolders\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\UI\JesterWheel</code></p>
<p>Opening <code>index.html</code> in a browser shows the wheel filled with the base content.</p>
<p>The website can be edited freely, changes are visible after reloading DCS
(<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>).</p>
<p>The UI logic, such as animations are defined in <code>renderer.js</code>, while the
interactions are handled in <code>main.js</code>.</p>
<p><code>interface.js</code> declares the base content of the wheel, as well as all methods
relevant for the C++ to JS communication.</p>
<p>The method <code>hb_send_proxy</code> is used to send commands to C++, such as notifying it
that an action has been clicked.</p>
<h2 id="lua"><a class="header" href="#lua">Lua</a></h2>
<p>The wheel is essentially a menu-tree. Each menu consists of up to 8 items. An
item might be final or contain another sub-menu. Additionally, a sub-menu can
also be spawned as outer-menu, which increases its item slots to 18.</p>
<p>Each item can be associated with an <code>action</code>, a string that is tied to the Event
System and can hence be reacted to if invoked.</p>
<p>To interact with the menu, several methods are defined and exported to Lua:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">Wheel.ReplaceMainMenu(main_menu)
Wheel.ReplaceSubMenu(sub_menu, menu_location)
Wheel.AddItem(item, menu_location)
Wheel.RemoveItem(item_name, menu_location)
Wheel.ReplaceItem(item, item_name, menu_location)
</code></pre>
<p>The following shows a simple example to add a new sub-menu to the <code>Navigation</code>
menu:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local waypoint_menu = Wheel.Item:new({
  name = &quot;Select Waypoint&quot;,
  menu = Wheel.Menu:new({
    name = &quot;Select Waypoint&quot;,
    items = {
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = &quot;TGT 1&quot;, action = &quot;select_tgt_1&quot; }),
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = &quot;TGT 2&quot;, action = &quot;select_tgt_2&quot; }),
      Wheel.Item:new({ name = &quot;Advanced&quot;, outer_menu = Wheel.Menu:new({
        name = &quot;More Waypoints&quot;,
        items = {
          Wheel.Item:new({ name = &quot;RTB&quot;, action = &quot;select_rtb&quot; }),
          Wheel.Item:new({ name = &quot;Nearest Target&quot;, action = &quot;select_tgt&quot; }),
        },
      })}),
    }
  }),
})

Wheel.AddItem(waypoint_menu, {&quot;Navigation&quot;})
</code></pre>
<p>To react to a selected action, listen to the corresponding event:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">ListenTo(&quot;select_tgt_1&quot;, function()
  Click(
    devices.NavigationComputer_AN_ASN_46A,
    device_commands.RIO_NAV_COMP_FUNCTION_SELECTOR_KNOB,
    3,
    5
  ) -- Target 1
end)
</code></pre>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="dialog-ui"><a class="header" href="#dialog-ui">Dialog UI</a></h1>
<p>Jester Dialog consists of a web-based frontend and offers an API exposed to Lua
for modifying its content and reacting to actions.</p>
<h2 id="frontend-1"><a class="header" href="#frontend-1">Frontend</a></h2>
<p>The frontend is a <a href="https://pixijs.com/">Pixi JS</a> based website defined in</p>
<p><code>f-4e\ModFolders\Mods\aircraft\F-4E\UI\JesterDialog</code></p>
<p>Opening <code>index.html</code> in a browser shows the dialog filled with example content.</p>
<p>The website can be edited freely, changes are visible after reloading DCS
(<kbd>SHIFT</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>).</p>
<p>The UI logic, such as animations are defined in <code>renderer.js</code>, while the
interactions are handled in <code>main.js</code>.</p>
<p><code>interface.js</code> declares the base content of the dialog, as well as all methods

<p>The method <code>hb_send_proxy</code> is used to send commands to C++, such as notifying it

<h2 id="lua-1"><a class="header" href="#lua-1">Lua</a></h2>
<p>Dialogs are shown on-demand and in-order. They are displayed for a certain time
and the user is given a chance to engage in the dialog or ignore it - upon which
it will expire and vanish.</p>
<p>A dialog consists of a question with up to 4 selectable options. An option is
either final or triggers a follow-up question with new options to select from.</p>
<p>Dialogs are hold and shown from a queue. A new dialog can be pushed to the queue
via:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">Dialog.Push(dialog)
</code></pre>
<p>The following shows a simple example to add a new dialog:</p>
<pre><code class="language-lua">local fuel_check_dialog = Dialog.Question:new({
  name = &quot;Jester&quot;,
  content = &quot;How is the fuel?&quot;,
  phrase = &quot;dialog/fuel_check&quot;,
  label = &quot;Fuel Check&quot;,
  timing = Dialog.Timing:new({
    question = s(5),
    action = s(10),
  }),
  options = {
    Dialog.Option:new({ response = &quot;We are good&quot;, action = &quot;fuel_good&quot; }),
    Dialog.Option:new({
      response = &quot;Fuel is low&quot;,
      follow_up_question = Dialog.FollowUpQuestion:new({

        content = &quot;Okay, how do you want to proceed?&quot;,
        phase = &quot;dialog/fuel_low_proceed&quot;,

          Dialog.Option:new({ response = &quot;RTB&quot;, action = &quot;fuel_low_rtb&quot; })
        },
      }),
    })
  },
})

Dialog.Push(fuel_check_dialog)
